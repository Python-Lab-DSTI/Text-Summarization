1,"Overall the course is great and the instructor is awesome. Machine learning is fascinating and I now feel like I have a good foundation.  A few minor comments: some of the projects had too much helper code where the student only needed to fill in a portion of the algorithm.  I would have preferred to have worked through more of the code. Also, there were a few times when the slides didn't contain the complete equations so it was difficult to piece it all together when writing the code.  Lastly, I wish that there was more coverage on vectorized solutions for the algorithms.",4
2,"This is an extremely basic course. Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized. So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).",1

4,I am Vietnamese who weak in English. To learn this course I have to choose playback rate 0.75.,5
5,Excellent starting course on machine learning. Beats any of the so called programming books on ML. Highly recommend this as a starting point for anyone wishing to be a ML programmer or data scientist.,5
6,It is the best online course for any person wanna learn machine learning. Andrew sir teaches very well. His pace is very good. The insights which you will get in this course turns out to be wonderful. ,5
7,"Sub title should be corrected. Since I'm not that good in English but I know when there're mis-traslated or wrong sub title. If you fix this problems , I thin it helps many students a lot. Thanks!!!!!",5
8,"The course covers a lot of material, but in a kind-of chaotic manner. There is a lot of math, so if you're not familiar with linear algebra you may find it really difficult. Personally, I don't quite understand the approach. The goal of this course seems to be to teach people how the algorithms work, and if so - there is just enough math, for the students to get lost, but not enough of it to truly understand what's going on internally in the algorithms.

10,"This course has of course (pun intended) built a formidable reputation for itself since it was laucnhed. I took the course in 2019 when it had been around for a few years and so what I am saying here may resonate with a lot of people who have taken the course before me. ""Concretely""(!), Prof Ng takes the student on a very well structured journey that covers the vast canvas of ML, explaining not just the theoretical aspects but also laying equal empahsis on the pratical aspets like debugging or choosing the right approach to solving a ML problem or deciding what to do first / next. At that level this course is highly recomended by me as the first course in ML that anyone should take. I do have a suggestion to make regarding how some of the portions could have been explained more lucidly. These are portions that pertain entirely to the mathematics and programming problems, where I struggled for days and (for back propogation) for months before realising that maybe the explanation given in the slide wasn't clear enough and at times i just needed to try really random ideas to get out of the programmin rut that I was stuck in. An advise for anyone doing the course would be to write down the matrices in full detail and do the transformations of cost fucntion and gradient descent or back prop using pen and paper and attempt to write the code for it only after once one is clear about the exact mathematical operation happening.

51,This is the best course I have ever taken. Andrew is a very good teacher and he makes even the most difficult things understandable.,5
52,It's a good introduction - not too complicated and covers a wide range of topics. The programming exercises are well put together and significantly help understanding. The free Matlab license is nice.,5
53,"One of the best course at Coursera, the content are very well versed, assignments and quiz are quite challenging and good, Andrew is one of the best guide we could have in our side.",5
54,Very well structured and delivered course. Progressive introduction of concepts and intuitive description by Andrew really give a sense of understanding even for the more complex area of the training.,5
55,Amazing course. It gets deep into the content and now I feel I know at least the basics of Machine Learning. This is definitely going to help me on my job! Thanks Andrew and the mentors of the course!,5
56,This course is amazing and covers most of the ML algorithms. I really liked that this course has emphasized math behind each technique which helps to choose the best algorithm while solving a problem.,5
57,"good course; just 2 suggestions: improve the skew data part (week 6) and furnish the formula to evaluate the number of iteration in the window from image dimension, window dimension and step (week 11)",5
58,"Great teaching style , Presentation is lucid, Assignments are at right difficulty level for the beginners to get an under the hood understanding without getting bogged down by the superfluous details. ",5
59,"However good the material and lectures may be, the use of an outdated version of Octave (which is not Mac-friendly and exceedingly brittle, to the extent where the supplied code requires manual patching in Windows and Linux) is a complete turn-off and makes it nearly impossible to complete the assignments on time unless you're prepared to spend at least twice as much time debugging your setup as doing the actual assignments.",1
60,"Perfect foundational overview of the topic with challenging exercises, at least for someone who left university over 20 years ago and has since then not done much with his skills in Linear Algebra ;-)",5
61,Amazing course for people looking to understand few important aspects of machine learning in terms of linear algebra and how the algorithms work! Definitely will help me in my future modelling efforts,5
62,"Very nicely explained the mathematical topics, even for people like me with some phobia regarding large formulas. Useful hands-on experience with MATLAB coding, which I would have had to learn anyway.",5
63,Explained well but I was not able to implement  it on exercise.,4
64,If this course was in python or R it would have been easier to understand. Octave/MATLAB is not that widely used.,3
65,This course could be a nice introduction and overview of the Machine Learning field.,2
66,"Level of difficulty of lectures is not correspond with level of quizzes. In lectures they are talking about simple stuff and then in quizzes they ask you about details they didn't mentioned. You could deducts this information though. But this is exactly the main problem with this course - for quizzes you should deduct and learn by yourself so much stuff, that videos start to be not worth your time.",2
67,This course is absolute garbage.  You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing. ,1
68,I‘m a Chinese post-graduate student of Computer Sciense. This class is very useful to me because of it's amazing course videos and the well-designed programming exercises. It is really lucky to have this opportunity to find the course and to finish it. This class will be a footstone for further studying in AI field for anyone who just get started.,5
69,This course is extremely helpful and understandable for engineers and researchers in the CS field. Many thanks to the prof. Ng Yew Kwang for his great course as well as supporters in the course forum.,5
70,An amazing skills of teaching and very well structured course for people start to learn to the machine learning. The assignments are very good for understanding the practical side of machine learning.,5
71,Have to give a star so I will give it one.  Others rate this course highly. I don't know why.,1
72,"Perhaps the greatest instructor and the greatest course, I enjoyed it so much I had continued to do it in between my exams and looking forward fto start or deeplearning,ai specialization in a few days ",5
73,"Course content was awesome, gave me lot of insights. If assignments were in Python, it would have helped a lot to improve my skills. Anyways I would recommend this course to a beginner who wants to understand the logic behind the machine learning process. Thank You AndrewNg Sir!!!",4
74,"Fairly good videos explaining the material, probably worth 4 starts.  However, the written support material should be improved.  IMHO the video should supplement the written material, i.e. it should be possible to learn the material only by reading.  This is not the case, so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to long-term memory.",2
75,"Overall, this is a great course and I learned an enormous amount of information.  The biggest issue I had was the disconnect between the course and the assignments/quizzes.  Although they had help sections, because you couldn't ask direct questions about the algorithms/quizzes, if you had a problem, you were basically on your own. (At least that is what it felt like.)  For example, if you missed a quiz question and couldn't figure out the answer, there seemed little recourse to find the actual answer.  In a couple cases, I decided to just take the 80% on a quiz simply because I had no idea what the answer was.",5
76,"My first open online course from Stanford University gave me a lot of energy. As my student years are far behind me (I am 76 years old) it was a discovery to become enthusiast in this new area. And building on my career in ICT, this is a surprising extension on the way systems can help us to develop a better life. Professor Ng is very good in offering in a controlled way many insights in the machine learning - now it is time for me to apply my new knowledge!",5
77,"Too many trainings and assignments without enough practice, exercise and examples. This can be very confusing for a person taking the course for the first time.",1
78,"Exceptional. Best course to start learning Machine Learning! Only one grouse though, the exercises are in Matlab and not in python.",5
79,"Very nice course,. Give a fundamental knowledge of machine learning in a clear, logic and easy-to-understand way. Suitable for those who has relatively weak background of math and statistics to learn. ",5
80,"The course will give you the incites to understand the data driven mathematical functions to write softwares that can behave or change its behavior, based on stimulus (data).",5
81,"Very good instruction for machine learning, and also very very good for new comers!!!",5
82,It was a great learning experience. All the lectures were in details.  ,5
83,It was a very helpful course.,5
84,Good Course,5
85,It would be nice if it's taught in either python or R. So I do need to take extra effort to learn octave. ,4
86,This is a very basic course on Machine Learning. The main drawbacks are:  ,2
87,I would rename this course as Programming Octave with Application to Machine Learning rather that Machine Learning. Once you start the course you will have to focus on Octave rather than on ML topics if you want to do programming exercises. There is no degree of freedom in programming. You are provided with a lot of weird Octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch. More than 50% of my time was spent in order to learn Octave and understand (guess!!!!) Octave codes. ,1
88,"Been asked to re-take all assignments *after* paying for a certificate! I wil never pay for a Coursera course again, and I would not recommend my friends to do so",1
89,"There's one saying in Chinese that says ""一日為師，終身為師"" which means once being someone's  teacher, even just one day, you're the teacher for the rest of his life. Thank you for all your efforts and I really appreciate it. I'll keep working on Machine Learning and hopefully one day I can do the same contribution to the human society as you did.",5
90,"Explanation was very good and assignment helps us to understand the real picture. The way course is planned along with octave exercise, Graphs and visualization of data (X,Y) is very good. Very good course who is starting the Machine learning from scratch.    ",5
91,This course is a very applicable. Professor Ng explains precisely each algorithm and even tries to give an intuition for mathematical and statistic concepts behind each algorithm. Thank you very much.,5
92,This is a great way to get an introduction to the main machine learning models. The professor is very didactic and the material is good too. I recommend it to everyone beginning to learn this science.,5
93,"This is course just awesome. You get everything you wanted from this course. It covers on all topics in detail, helps in getting confidence in learning all the techiques and ideas in machine learning.",5
94,So much like it. It gave me starting push in this interesting topic. And one important thing that after this course I figured out I need to continue dive into machine learning.,5
95,Excellent Machine Learning Lessons which need little advanced knowledge of mathematics.,5
96,Too easy and too slow,2
97,"The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching. The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants. You're interested in this course either to (a) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and/or (b) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile. In both cases, move on. The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap.  ",1
98,There are too many mistakes and misleading statements made in the course material. There were a lot difficulties with submitting assignments in order to move forward in the course. I had to give up because I don't have time to be bogged down like this.,1
99,"The exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff, then push you off. No guidance. Good luck if you don't already know linear algebra, matrix math, and matlab. I'll be looking elsewhere to learn about Machine Learning. Glad I didn't pay for this course! ",1
100,I would not recommend taking this course any more. (2018),1
101,"The course is well organised, with cutting edge knowledge ready to use in our information era. And Andrew was really decent with clear illustration and explanations. I really enjoy taking this course!",5
102,THIS IS A REVIEW FOR BEGINNERS,4
103,"If it was in python, then it would have got 5 star from me.",4
104,"It is a good course that covers essential topics related to Machine learning. But unfortunately, the quality of videos and sound are not satisfying. Besides, there are lots of mistakes in videos, notations, and even in programming assignments. It is time-consuming to check Errata for each week to find out which part has mistakes!! It is even got worse when I was in the middle of a programming assignment and I confused by the WRONG algorithms in the question and notation in the videos. In programming assignment 4, it took a week when I finally realized my mistake occurred because of the wrong algorithm in the videos and the assignment. I found out these problems confused all the students and its evidence is the comments in the forums and responses form mentors.",2
105,"В
 требованиях к прохождению курса необходимо указать ""владение университетским курсом высшей математики"" и ""математический английский"" - без него тут нечего 
делать, поскольку текстовка на русском языке не совпадает с тем, что говорит лектор ни по смыслу, ни, начиная со второй недели, по времени.

",1
106,"The course may be great, but the sound of the video is really terrible, this is a big problem for me and possibly to other users, at the point where I decided to stop watching.",1
107,This course is definitely not for beginners. ,1
108,I really enjoyed this course. I learned new exciting techniques. I think the major positive point of this course was its simple and understandable teaching method. Thanks a lot to professor Andrew Ng.,5
109,so useful,5
110,"This course was very difficult, coming from a non-math/matlab background, but did teach me a heck ton about the world of machine learning, for which I am eternally grateful. Life got in the way big time, and it took a lot of time and energy to complete the programming exercises. There was also a lot I didn't understand, and I did wish there was maybe another week of getting used to certain concepts, particularly maths issues like double summing. I appreciate that this would complicate things though. I found that I am not geared towards the forums - my learning style involves conversation and not really experimenting on my own (which I can do once I understand a concept). As helpful as the mentors were, only relying on the forums with my time schedule meant that that taking this course dragged on longer than I would have liked. I also got a bit overwhelmed by the lack of centralised information. I know that it would require a complete overhaul to sort such out, but it did make looking up information time-consuming. Nevertheless, I am grateful for all that I learnt, and appreciate that I plunged into the deep end. I don't understand everything, and of course a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but I know enough to know what to refer to should I ever need ML in my next job. Thank you. ",3
111,Excellent lessons by Prof. Andrew Ng.,3
112,The course didn't convince me at all. Practice and applications in real life are in short supply. I missed the art and pedagogy of Trainer.,1
113,Huge amounts of assumed understanding make this course impenetrable.,1
114,"The BEST course I ever had in my life, even better than a typical classroom based interactive teaching.",5
115,"Amazing course. I had no idea of programming and my maths were more than rusted, but the way the lessons are taught, made the way a whole lot easier. If you're like me (zero programing and maths), it's no easy task to complete the course. But if you put the right amount of effort, patience and dedication, combined with the great videos and reference material, is totally doable. ",5
116,"Truly an exceptional class. Not often will someone with a deep proficiency in a discipline have the time or incentive to share their insights and teach to others; this class is a rare exception, and given the vital importance of machine learning to the future, I have a great appreciation and debt to Andrew Ng. ",5
117,"Great class! Should be recommended for every individual who wants to learn machine learning and don't have time or oppotunity to take a class at their own univerisity, this class is a guidance for the basis of machine learning and gives me instructions where to go next. Thank Ng really much.",5
118,This course was very well taught. There was a impressive focus on the basics and fundamentals of each topic. The lecture slides encapsulates the topics well and thus there was no such need of making my own notes which speeded up the learning process ;).,5
119,One of the best online courses I have attended in a decade. Thank you to Coursera for making this course available. I cannot express my gratitude enough to professor Andrew Ng for this awesome course!,5
120,sehr gut!,5
121,"This was a great course, and I highly recommend it! Andrew Ng made me feel like he's my machine learning pal. I can see why this course is so popular.",4
122,"I like the course very much. One point where it could be improved are the assignments: it is really nice to be guided and to have a big part of the programming prepared but the drawback is that many times I didn't feel in control of what was happening. For example, that was hard to know basic features of the implementation (is this data a row vector? a column vector?) since I didn't decide it. This leads me to spend quite some time on trying to fix simple problems. In short, I wish I had felt more ""empowered"" during the assignments. ",4
123,"Good introduction course, giving an overview of machine learning algorithms and some methodology. Off course a lot can be added, but it's a good start for people with little to no knowledge or experience in this field. A few points that could be improved: I would like to have better material support for each section. Marked-up slides are not a great support for reviewing the different sections afterwards.",3
124,"I don't know why people have overated  this course. I have attended other courses and they never skip the topics and jump to other. 1) The voice of Mr Andrew is horrible, its extremely low, and not consistent at all which is really very annoying, we have to look at the subtitles and rewind back and see actually what we explained on the screen. 2) The way he explains is really not good, I really have to re-run the lectures again and again to understand, as he jumps and don't explain why this/that happened. Everytime we have to search the forum for answers. Really not happy with the course. ",3
125,The course is not for people with not mathematical backgrounds plus its using matlab.. these days R and Python are more used in the industry for ML. I found to this course via friends that said it's hard but very recommended.. i think there are easier courses online that can deliver the same concepts ,2
126,Certificate is expensive!,2
127,"The test questions don't match the lecture material. It seemed that the tests were written by another person. Also tests contain errors, because according to the lecture material, answer should be correct, but by marking it the system tell me that it's incorrect.",1
128,"i got stuck in one quiz i thought that maybe it was just me, i tried it a second time and got it wrong again.",1
129,"Poor audio and video quality, what compromises the learning process",1
130,The course content is vastly outdated and superficial. ,1
131,"Before I go into why I liked this course so much, let me give a little context on my motivation to taking it. My background is a Bachelors in Math, and 9 years working in finance in a role involving very little computer science or statistics. I wanted a change of industries into the world of Data, for which a significant amount of learning and retraining were necessary; however before just enrolling on and committing to a masters degree, I wanted to answer some questions. Do I enjoy this? Am I able to learn it? Do I want to take this field a step further? Fortunately, the answer to all of my questions was positive. ",5
132,"To set some context: I am a graduate (PhD) in Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin with over 10 years of experience in both academia and industry.  My goal in taking this course was to learn the basics of Machine Learning, and understand what the current excitement about ML and AI is all about.  I dedicated 3-4 hours every week, over the last 12 weeks, towards learning this course — and watched all the videos, reviewed all the lecture .pdfs and completed all the project assignments and all quizzes in the course on time. ",5
133,Extraordinary course for beginners (as well as for people with experience)!,5
134,"Before starting this course, I had no previous knowledge of machine learning and I had never programmed in Octave and I have little/no programming skills. This is a 11-week course and so I was not sure if I would make it to the end (or even get through the first week) but I was keen to learn something new. ",5
135,"This is a terrific class!  The Course is well structured in terms of videos, invideo pop-up quizzes, course notes, programming exercises, and the discussion boards & mentor community.  The 11 weeks includes 8 programming exercises, with usually 5-6 ""code submittals"" per exercise. ",5
136,"I would definitely recommend this course! I was very impressed by the quality of the lectures. Professor Ng uses the medium very well. He's easy to follow and the content is solid.The assignments were also good. They provide a ton of scaffolding, so you rarely have to write a lot of code, but if you never used Matlab before (like me) and it's been awhile since you've taken linear algebra (also true for me), then ""thinking in terms of vectorization"" takes a bit of getting used to. I'm really happy that I've been exposed to it, though, and it's pretty impressive how much computation you can express in one or two lines of Matlab.I only had to use the forums once at the beginning to figure out why I couldn't submit assignments. (It turned out that my version of Octave was too new for what the assignments had been tested with.) Once I got that sorted out, I never had to go back there for help, which I thought was a good sign that the assignments were clear and had been through sufficient testing by the staff.It's certainly a bit of a time commitment. I would probably budget at least 5 hours per week. I took a lot of notes, so I paused/rewound the videos a bunch, so it took longer for me to ""watch"" the videos than the advertised time.Again, the assignments were often not that much code, and I think they started to take me less time as I progressed through the course as I got more familiar with Octave and the style of the assignments. They aren't there to trick you or separate the wheat from the chaff: they're really there to reinforce the concepts from lecture and have you write some code yourself so you have some chance of writing your own code for your own project machine learning project one day.If anything, the assignments provide much more help than I expected. That is, if this were an in-person course where I could go to office hours or whatever if I got stuck, I would expect the assignments to provide less scaffolding and to force you to struggle quite a bit on your own more. (Maybe I just have bad flashbacks to undergrad or something.)",5
137,"Really a great course. It covered a large variety of currently popular machine learning algorithms, along with strategies to do machine learning projects. Professor Andrew really goes deep into how to optimize a machine learning model to reduce bias and improve performance with a lot of techniques, not just simply implement a fancy machine learning algorithm. At first, I complained about programming assignments because it is done in Matlab, but after I went through some of them I really discovered that Matlab is a powerful tool used for a broad range of purposes. The course goes beyond just model.fit(x,y) and model.predict(x,y), because you'll learn the essence and mathematical proof of each ML algorithm to really comprehend how each algorithm work and how optimization work. You can still learn to build ML models in python even by yourself after this course. ",5
138,"I knew nothing about Machine learning when I started this course. I am going to start a job where I have to verify hardware for machine learning and I wanted to understand the vocabulary of machine learning better before beginning this new job. I got that from this course and a lot more! I liked the balance of mathematics, modeling and hardware aspects of this course. A key aspect of this course that elevates it is how Andrew always emphasizes evaluating the model / algorithm with real number outputs and not just plug ahead at full speed. ",5
139,"This have been a very good and comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, IMHO. It have given me the all basic introduction to ML that I could have hoped for. (I'm a senior practitioner of many forms of mathematical modelling and programming, as a former Astrophysics Phd.)",5
140,"Professor Ng is a great teacher, his course is both challenging and satisfying.  The exercises require you to take one step beyond the lecture -- not just parrot back the transcript -- you have to think about the implications of what you've just studied.  Yet Ng's presentations are lucid and informative and that next step is obvious, once you think about it.  ",5
141,This course is an intro-level course for Machine Learning which mainly focus on the implementation of those algorithms. It doesn't mention much math behind which makes it suitable for people even have no previous knowledge in related area. But make sure you have at least basic knowledge about linear algebra and calculus. You won't need those for the exercises but would help you better understand the course.,5
142,"This is the first course I ever took on Machine Learning. I have a good background in linear algebra. Therefore, Mathematical aspects of the course was not a big challenge for me. At the same time, Professor Ng explains the ideas behind each ML algorithm in an easily comprehensible manner. It is easy to follow his videos except the sound quality. I would strongly recommend that they improve sound quality.",5
143,"It's so wonderful that it can't be explained by the words and at the same time i am very sad that Ng sir has left us . i just love Ng sir , He is so wonderful person and teacher that can't be explained by the words .It's quite bit a big dream but   i am dreaming of some day in the future where i am working with Ng sir on some machine learning problem and he is guiding me as he is doing now . I just love the course and also the mentors Mr. Neil Ostrove and Mr. Tom he had helped us to complete this course and assignment and also solved my useless something baby problems more carefully and i will help other student as guided by Ng sir in completing this course smoothely . and that's all . at the last i want to tell I just fall in love with Ng sir and coursera and the team . i have a big dream of meeting that my favourite Ng sir on some day.     ",5
144,"Thank you Professor Ng for taking the time to produce such a phenomenal course. As mystifying as machine learning can appear to be, your well-paced and digestible teaching style gave me the opportunity to understand. With fantastic lectures, mid-video quizzes, end of topic quizzes, and programming assignments, you as a student are given all the resources you need to absorb the material.",5
145,"I've tried DataCamp and recently take my first course in Coursera. The difference is huge and important if anyone wish to learn more about ML or DS. This course does not focus much on 'just coding' the answer. It aims to teach you the logic, basic maths behind ML algorithms. ",5
146,"As a non-CS student, I really have learned a lot from this course, which does not only cover several typical algorithms, but also a lot of important concepts in ML. It can be told from all these lecture videos that Prof. Ng has put a great effort in this course - he is not just reading the pre-prepared materials; instead he has sincerely shared a lot of his experiences in industry and pointed out the typical pitfalls that a lot of ML engineers have fallen in. This really inspires me and lets me develop a lot of awareness to avoid similar mistakes in the future.",5
147,"Excellent introduction class to ML! Prof Ng provides clear explanations always and makes Machine Learning simple.  I have learned to go with the flow of the videos, not worrying when I was not understanding some parts knowing that a clear explanation would be provided in the following minutes.  Although this course is not interactive, Prof. Ng communicates well with his passion, and always ""responds"" to my questions in the videos. The quiz and exercises are very well thought of, really testing that we learn the essential and got a good feeling for the concepts.",5
148,"Excellent course for a depp introduction to machine learning. The professor Andrew NG has a special way to explain complicated themes in a very simple and understandable way. In the main videos of this course is more intuition than deep math and statistical demonstrations, but if you eager to understand issues more deeply like me you will find in the ""resources"" area of the course links to the documentation and the lecture videos of the machine learning course given in Stanford, there you could find the math and statistical demonstrations, also a bunch more algorithms to learn. Also you will find links to refresh your calculus, linear algebra and statistical skills if needed and links to data repositories to practice your new skills.",5
149,"Mr. Andrew Ng has mastery on Machine Learning. His method of teching is precise and lucid, often engaging us to think more on untouched aspects of ML. This was my first course and first step (a baby step) on any platform to understand and learn ML . Lucky to have enrolled for this amazing course and I sincerely thank him for being instructor on this subject and also tons of thanks to mentors who clear doubts in discussion forums. It helped a lot. Lastly , I think this course has clearly set my path towards advanced studies in ML.  Although, statistics and some of the terms did bounce off my head few times, I hope to revisit and work on them more in future. Thankyou Andrew Ng Sir !   I am your fan now !!!  :)",5
150,"I so appreciate it from COURSERA and DR ANDREW NG for this unbelievable course. It was definitely one of the best courses I've ever seen in my whole 20-year life. I'm from Iran and I have really restricted rules for having access to such courses. I'm so glad to have this opportunity to attend a class with a professor from Stanford University. I'm not good at English very well but I don't know why I feel that at the end of the class Prof NG was kind of sad from ending the course and I was nearly to cry seeing him like this. here I'm gonna promise this for the first time, I promise to spend my whole life to do what Prof NG did for me in this course, to help others. Thank you so very much. ",5
151,"After finishing the course, I feel much more confident in pursuing more advanced machine learning. The course teaches everything intuitively and in detail but maybe it could use some improvement to achieve perfection. It would be better if the course could provide pointers to some of the topics beyond the scope of the course such as the derivation of the back propagation, svm, pca, etc. Because often times when you search for derivations they might not be very useful for your levels, if course could provide some good references as some lecture notes after the video would be great for the students to gain even more solid groundings of the things behind the hood",5
152,"As a machine learning newbie, I can say this course is really helpful to get in depth intuition on how machine learning algorithms work. Techniques to evaluate and improve our algorithms are also explained very well. Programming exercises are really challenging. Review questions are also crafted well. Though this course uses Octave/Matlab instead of python for programming, I find it quite useful to understand and implement algorithms easily. Only negative of this course is, mathematics involved is not explained in detail. Overall, this course has helped me a lot to understand machine learning in a better and useful way.",5
153,"This is a very good course which gives a good solid foundation in the basics concepts of Machine Learning. Prof. Andrew explains reasonably complicated algorithms in a very intuitive way which goes reasonably deep, but at the same time doesn't overwhelm the student with a lot of underlying mathematics. The course structure also follows a very natural progression (linear regression --> logistic regression --> neural network --> SVM) and bringing in other basic concepts like feature normalization, regularization, measurements etc. along the way. Definitely one of the better designed courses I've seen so far.",5
154,"I've been working with machine learning for a while and I've used different supervised and unsupervised algorithms.  However, this course taught me about how these different machine learning algorithms work under the hood.  Professor Ng is a great teacher.  His method of describing the problem set, giving the intuition on how to go about solving the problem and slowly defining the algorithm works very well.  This course has the right amount of breadth by covering only the most applicable algorithms and has the right amount of depth by covering the math and the intuition behind each algorithm.",5
155,"This is the most amazing class that I have taken in a long time. The attention to detail is incredible. I appreciated the most all the context Andrew gives around evaluating algorithms and models, reasoning about finding errors and taking steps to improve the performance. This course gives you so much more than just the algorithms and makes sure you think for yourself and truly understand the topics.",5
156,This is the first ever course I have taken on Machine Learning and I have to say that it was the best course that I have ever taken till I have taken the DeepLearinig Specialization by Andrew Ng.,5
157,"The course is very well structured for me, a student who has some understanding of machine learning but would like to get a systematic introduction of the subject. ",5
158,"I would give this class 4.5 stars (rounds up to 5).  Many different ML topics are covered, and they are presented at an appropriate pace for learning.  The programming assignments are a great way to review the content and make sure you understand some of the details.  Past experience with linear (matrix) algebra will be helpful but not required.  Be sure to consult the resources that are available, especially the errata (it was a little disappointing how many small errors are present) and the lecture notes.  But overall, I highly recommend this course.",5
159,"Great Course!. I took this course after having been formally trained in topics such as Numerical Optimization, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Linear Regression and other topics and I found these classes to be both very informative and refreshing. Learned something that sometimes some courses out there forget to mention which is how to draw meaningful statistics to analyze your algorithms performance and also things like what do work on next. I definitely advice people to take this course even if you are a pretty advanced learner on these topics.",5
160,"This course is very well designed, covers a lot of topics with a lot of rigourous detail, but Andrew Ng introduces them giving some intuition about them, before diving into the deeper Maths. Assignments are very challenging, but with some boilerplate code already done, they are immensely satisfying, as you end up achieving with some implementations of pretty cool problems. I have done linear algebra and regression and PCA before, so was able to complete it rather quickly, but this should be very approachable and useful for everyone. ",5
161,"I am based in Tokyo, Japan and  working for Marketing in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.  Marketing is now digital and data driven. In order to improve marketing data science skill, I took this course. This course and Professor Andrew Ng is amazing and could learn Machine Learning comprehensively.  Recommendation system and clustering is very relevant to marketing job and would like contribute to the world based on the knowledge what I learned in this course. Many thanks for your guidance and great teaching, Professor Andrew san !",5
162,"This course is an amazing and extensive resource for machine learning, that isn't afraid to dive into the math behind ML. I thoroughly enjoyed all the intuitive explanations and examples given by the instructor. By focusing on the core concepts of ML, rather than on a specific programming language or library, this course ensures that it stays relevant even years after it was released. Overall, this course may be a little challenging for some people, but it is certainly worth all the time invested in it.",5
163,"A very good course for beginners who want to study machine learning. Mr Andrew Ng is a very good teacher and very experienced in machine learning. The course structure is what it should be for an ML course. Programming exercises are really brainstorming and must be solved. Online threads can be used to seek help from other students and mentors, and are really effective. Reading slides are important for making notes.",5
164,"The real way to learn Machine Learning is this, no black box;understanding using pure mathematics makes it more interesting, and as I was solving the programming exercises I got to know, how simply vectors and calculus can be used to represent complex mathematical formulas. All the hours completing this course was worth. Once I started using machine learning libraries, all concepts were no longer black box for me, suddenly everything started making sense. Highly Recommended course for beginners.",5
165,This was the hardest thing I've done in ages. I gave up at some point until a breakthrough in programming - I learning to use operations with matrices. I did all programming assignments in python. Couldn't finish the Neural Network - I was stuck for a month because I couldn't wrap my head around mathematical operation in backpropagation. Overall this was a journey. Every morning and evening learning on the way in the bus to and from work. Also lonely weekends. Finished. Can't thank you enough.,5
166,"It is an amazing course for beginners who wish to know about Machine Learning. Taking the course and getting high-level knowledge of how different ML Algorithm works can be very useful and (in some cases, it is must) before using any libraries to create solutions. And for such cases, this course is certainly one of the best. ",5
167,"A great introduction to Machine Learning. Found the pace of the lectures just right with a good balance of theory, worked examples and practical tips. I did Maths with Statistics at university and so found some of the concepts familiar but great to refresh! The coding assignments were well-explained and was able to walk through them step-by-step with the instructions. Really enjoyed the course and excited to start testing it out on some problems of my own!",5
168,"The explanation of each and every topic is so simple and easy. The course is taught by prof. Andrew Ang and covers the major concepts of machine learning. He also provides a good intuition about the topic so to understand them better. Overall this course is awesome and I would highly recommend to someone who is a beginner in Machine Learning. I am very grateful to Professor, Mentors and the Coursera for this amazing journey of 11 weeks in machine learning.",5
169,"I'm 50 years old and never thought that a career change can happen at this stage. This course gives you the basics and knowledge of how your trained data is fitted into a model; then used to predict/estimate the output of your next set of data. More importantly, it gave me the confidence to go deeper into the field of machine learning. I'm enrolling to get certified in ""Deep Learning Specialization"" on Coursera. Maybe we'll meet in your next AI adventure.",5
170,"This course i actually the first decent course I have taken in Machine Learning. It's really good if you have absolute no idea about what machine learning is. Don't fear the math, because Andrew (the instructor) really explains everything really good. Although a bit of programming experience is necessary, you can cover it while watching the lectures. I wanted to say the Instructor and the Mentors THANK YOU for sharing these extrordinary material with us.",5
171,"Amazing Course by an amazing professor ! I am a Mechanical Engineer, and don't have any IT / Data experience. But even then how Professor Ng laid down ML foundations and took the course forward was very smooth. I am glad I took this course and I hope that the Professor keeps coming out with more advanced videos on ML. Thank you Andrew Ng for the months of work and dedication you put in for coming out with such a brilliant course for us students !",5
172,"Best online course I've ever taken so far, and it's free! Please keep it always free! ML is not my field but thanks to this wonderful course I now have a very good high-level grasp of the argument as well as some technical knowledge to start tackling real-word problems. Andrew Ng is an exceptional teacher. Assignments are a great way to commit theoretical concepts to memory. You will also learn the basics of Octave/Matlab which is useful per se.",5
173,"Amazing class, great lecturer. A really good introduction and overview of machine learning concepts. It  often skips the detailed mathematical background, to make it accessible for a wider audience, but I still found  that enough information was given that allowed me to work  out these details on my own. A lot of effort was put into creating the programming assignments, they provide a great hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms.  ",5
174,"Although this is an introductory Machine Learning course, it covers all the important aspects and all the common algorithms, the programming skill is not so necessary with Matlab, a production-ready software, or its free software clone Octave, even if it is needed GPU acceleration. This course was much easier than I expected, even considering the lack of unnecessary mathematical theory, it was teacher Andrew Ng who made it possible.",5
175,Hello this is Sparsh kaushik and i just completed my ML course offered by Stanford.,5
176,This is the most interesting course that I had ever taken. I want to thank my tutor Andrew Ng for teaching those wonderful things. This course even changed my career path and also made me superior to my teammates by knowing these cool stuff. I have also designed some applications using the concepts I had learned in this course. Lastly I am grateful to my tutor @Andrew_Ng for make profession life more fruitful. ,5
177,"This course is a really amazing and well taught course.Andrew sir is really a very good teacher and he made the complex topics quite easy to understand with his cool examples.Moreover, the optimization techniques and advises given for debugging or improving the machine learning program were really helpful. I hope I can take full advantage of this course and build up a career in machine learning.",5
178,Fabulous course for starters of machine learning.,5
179,"This course was splendidly awesome. I am in my final year from grade C engineering college in New Delhi, India.

Thanks to Andrew NG Sir who made this great website for students like us and such an best class content. Highly Recommended to all! ",5
180,"Great Course to start with Machine Learning. All algorithms and technical expects are covered and explained in detail. Assignments are well framed and gives you a proper intuition on algorithms use and performance on real world data. Also appreciate the advise on debugging and optimizing algorithms on small test examples, before running on large data sets. ",5
181,"Hi Andrew, ",5
182,"Very eye-opening for a person with a very little knowledge of the aspects and maths behind machine learning. The exercises were somewhat difficult since it's been 15 years since my last maths class and I really haven't been doing it since. So a lot of effort really needed, but once you've done it, it feels great!",5
183,"I loved this course. Loved the way of teaching and how well structured it was. I can only recommend using the programming test cases when doing the exercises. I wanna thank Prof. Ng and the Tutors of this course. It has been a great experience. If I had the choice, I would purchase this course again, no doubts!",5
184,"There are a lot of courses about Machine Learning, but this one is very comprehensive and it also goes deep to the theoretical base, so you do not rely on ready-made libraries, rather you have to write your own code in GNU Octave. I highly recommend this course for everyone who wants to do ML as her career.",5
185,Great comprehensive way to break into machine learning as a subject. I feel confident that this has provided the foundation I need to further explore the subject either by reading up on new topics in the machine learning area or thinking about how to apply machine learning concepts to my personal projects.,5
186,Found this course extremely useful to build up the basics of machine learning and its application on the real world.  Quizzes and programming exercises were very helpful and apt. Enjoyed a lot while learning these complex algorithms. Thank you Andrew sir and the Course Era team for creating this course.,5
187,"It was my first time, that I have to come in contact with machine learning. This course helped me pretty much to understand the basic problems. It was a very good introduction, very well explained by Prof. Andrew Ng and I can realy recommend doing this class not only for beginners.  Thanks for that!",5
188,Majored in actuarial science so machine learning is not a new word to me. Some of the techniques are very simple such as linear regression. Andrew is so clear and organized which helps me figure out a line in between. The projects are pretty easy but sometimes need plenty of time to debug. ,5
189,"This course was fantastic! I can honestly say that I learned more in this course than any course that I have ever taken. It was challenging, but doable with time and effort and well worth it! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a rigorous foundation in machine learning.",5
190,"Awesome course,",5
191,"If you want to learn how to apply machine learning in a wide range of practical settings, this is the course to take! Professor Andrew Ng obviously put a lot of time and care into developing this course and preparing the excercises to provide you with a really smooth learning curve.",5

289,"I'm not crazy about online learning.  There are certain aspects of classroom learning that online learning can't give.  But as far as online learning goes, this course is probably about as good as it ever gets.",4
290,"Very well made, well paced. Better than majority of college courses. Some errors do pop up midway through the course that should be addressed. It can be frustrating to push through these issues sometimes but they are the only thing keeping from 5 stars.",4
291,"it is one of the best course for beginners in machine learning, the only thing it lacks is its python implementation. If there is the python implementation of this course then no other course is better than this one",4
292,"Well explained, at the end of this course you will understand the subject and hold coherent conversations about it. Matlab implementation relatively simple, maybe too much so. Highly recommended course. ",4
293,"There is a lot to say about you Andrew sir but in few words - ""Thank you very much for teaching us the ML concepts in such a beautiful manner """,4
294,Very instructive course.,4
295,"Great course, but the sound quality is quite bad. ",4
296,Better upgrade from matlab to Python,4
297,"Well, this course has at least 3 undeniable cons:",3
298,"This course needs to be severely updated and fixed. It is mostly kept alive by the amazing community of mentors, in particular, Tom Mosher. Without Tom, I would have gotten extremely frustrated with the weird quirks that come about during assignments. One important piece of advice: if you can do assignments in an Octave environment such as GNU Octave 4.0.3, I'd strongly recommend it (Althought it tends to crash ofter, so save, save, save!!!).",3
299,The course needs a platform where people can actually apply all techniques independently and learn by way of being graded on their accuracies in prediction. Otherwise the assignments just become a mere copy-paste mechanism of the formulae provided in the pdfs. ,3
300,Too easy for people with background in machine learning. But would be a good introductory one if you have zero understanding in machine learning and want to change your career track. ,3
301,Sadly it's just introduction. And i would recommend to make course for python instead of matlab/octave,3
302,"Content was OK, but quality of teaching was fair at best -- important points glossed over, many not made clear at all, some simply omitted: Bayes classifiers, decision trees, etc, etc.. Audio visual quality of lectures poor. Ng's onscreen scrawls and voice recording were terrible, and there were many mistakes in graphics. Numerous typographical errors in exercise instruction .pdf's. Exercise text itself (ex__.m files) had numerous ""pauses"" that failed to instruct the user what he had to do (or not do) next, so you had to carefully examine what followed. If more care was put into exercise construction, the ""pause"" text in the command window would not just say ""Enter to continue"" but say what coding action was needed to continue. Obviously a lot of work has already been done on interactivity: Quizzes, online Submit scripts, which for me all worked extremely well. But clearly the course could use a lot of improvement in many aspects. Thus I grade it: C-",2
303,"Sorry to give just 2 stars, but the course lacks effectiveness, big time.",2
304,"Dr. Yang does an excellent job explaining concepts and showing the detailed mechanics of any example he brings up.  This being said, I felt the course offered more of an overview, and for anyone with a college statistics and programming course, this won't be very useful, frankly.  The course didn't provide lots of new information, and I think much of the actual theory and implementation for ML and its applications would be better broken up into a series of more rigorous courses.  This would however, be a good fit for someone working in management who needs a quick understanding of the most basic principles of ML.",2
305,"While the contents are good and the teaching pace is just right, I am deeply disappointed by the lethargy of Coursera in not fixing trivial errors in its assessment tests. Answers for even some trivial questions are graded as incorrect. Those result in incorrect grading and a frustration. When I am paying to get the assessments and a completion certificate, this is just NOT acceptable!",2
306,"Sound clarity is so poor sometime the volume is very low and some point it too hight, how can we concentrate on the course. Online course are stand on two main pillar video and audio, video s good but audio 2/5.",2
307,Material of this course could be presented much deeper. Mr. Ng tries to avoid mathematical explanations.  ,2
308,"Out of date, and video quality bad enough to be distracting",2
309,Assignments are very messy.,2
310,"I was quite disappointed in this class where the exercises are too onerous and out of date. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks are not covered. Also, a lot of the material is dated from 6 years ago. There was also no help when I wanted to ask a question. When I asked where a certain material will be covered I did not get any response either. The last 1-2 sections were also wrong as I know that is not what is done in the industry. You will be disappointed if you take this course after a lot of work.",1
311,the quizzes were very good but the programming tests were badly made and not well enough explained.,1
312,"Lioso y muy mal organizado. Las preguntas de los test hacen referencia a otros temas y la puntuación es injusta. En general, muy decepcionado y voy a pedir la devolución del dinero.",1
313,"My feeling is that the author of this course has no idea what is ""Machine learning"" - I have the impression that he repeats slogans which he does not understand.",1
314,A good set of questions contain only one best answer and that is in measurement and evaluation.  ,1
315,theory is intuitive and ok but rated program assignments are just waste of time.,1
316,Locked assignments are really frustrating.Why to wait till a specific date?,1
317,Python should have been great language for this course.,1
318,"My CS friend recommended me to take this course to learn more about how to use data in business, after he heard that I wanted to program an app for food. he warned me about the great deal of math involved (mainly linear algebra). me being a physics/engineering major I naturally got even more excited (it turned out that he was right, and it would also be a huge plus to know multivariate calculus, and I can see myself struggle with the concepts had I not studied both these topics to bits in school). incidentally, this was my first online coursera experience. I can tell you it will be life changing experience. No longer do I have to physically travel somewhere to listen to lectures or hand in assignments, nor download lecture notes off of the school server. This is a 24/7 always on always available service, with the best TA's to answer your questions if you get stuck on homework assignments and quizzes. Everything in the coding assignments tests your knowledge of the course lectures and is designed such that you can complete it in the shortest possible amount of time while reaping the maximum amount of benefit. It is  ""easy"" sense does not require you to grind through mundane things like looking for your own training set data or writing code to plot and visualise the data, but it is ""hard"" in the sense that very often it takes an hour (or more) of studying the lectures and thinking to figure out how to solve the problem in the most efficient way as possible which often involves writing a single line of vectored matlab/octave code. It is more of an overview of the most important topics in machine learning, but will be a great springboard to go in depth into each aspect of it. Lastly, Andrew often offers wonderful insights into the day to day of machine learning professionals in his lecture videos, so I would advise watching every single minute of them to get the most out of the course instead of aiming to race over the finish line (which can be tempting at times when the deadline approaches)",5
319,"This course is vital. People can do machine learning using out-of-the-box tools like keras, fast.ai, theano, tensorflow, and do amazing things. But to understand what's going on internally, to understand what it takes to get things to converge fast and to perform accurately and to be as useful as possible, to understand various types of networks and new discoveries later on, it really takes a good, healthy, rigorous foundation at least in very simple calculus, matrix algebra, back-prop, stochastic gradient descent, linear and logical regression, and such. If you try to forge ahead and get stuck or cannot come up with a way to build a proper model later on, you may find yourself giving up or returning to the material provided in this course. Andrew Ng did an excellent job teaching this. Even so, I heartily recommend watching views from others to get unstuck or to reinforce what you have learned--to make it more concrete. And do all the assignments aiming for 100% on every one.I found myself viewing youtube videos from many experts and found most of them extremely interesting and exciting. By getting several people's perspective, I feel I was able to learn the material better and more easily. Of course, it helps to have a math background, too, and I received my BA in math long ago from Fresno State with an Applied Math option and a Physics minor. It was a joy to return to my old math stomping grounds.If it takes time to get through, that's OK. Sometimes it helps to let the material marinate or let your brain marinate in the material. Then if you're like me, you might come to the place where you start to get on a roll and decide you need to put everything else aside and focus on finishing *this* course to perfection. And it can open the door not only to interesting work but to other interesting and worthwhile certifications.",5
320,"I
found the Machine Learning course has a good structure, excellent teaching
instruction and a perfect pace for working professionals. It covers a wide variety
of topics/techniques in Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.",5
321,"This course is an essential tool. I am beginning on a long journey of machine learning I hope will end at my ultimate goal of securing employment in the field of natural language processing and deep reinforcement learning. Starting completely from scratch, I began this journey by getting text books on the topics and attempting to follow along. Many of the basic learning algorithms, which seemed so daunting at first, were explained to me in a way that allowed me to fully embrace and understand the topics on an intuitive level. This course is the essential entry point to anyone wanting to truly understand the mechanics of machine learning. The mathematical concepts are broken down in a way that is truly intuitive and easy to follow. Additionally, Andrew Ng is a world class instructor. His manner, presentation, and encouragement from, at the time of this review, 8 years ago is evergreen and invaluable. He sincerely believes anyone who puts the time into learning this material can accomplish great things in the world. This course was inspiring. I was so engrossed with the material that I completed all 11 weeks of course work within 5 weeks. My only issue is the use of MATLAB/Octave in this course. All the materials I have read state that these languages and applications are widely not used in the field anymore though at the time of the course development, I understand the inclusion. Perhaps an update to the course that allows for the programming to be done in Python or R would be beneficial, but once you get the hang of MATLAB the programming exercises become easier as the course moves on. My sincerest and most heartfelt recommendation goes to this course for anyone who has an interest in opening the door to their own journey into this field. ",5
322,"I worked for a start-up specialising in AI and rules based software that aims to learn how attorneys review contracts to extract key data points (e.g. clauses, parties, names, dates, numbers and text classification).  Although I worked in sales / presales and as a domain expert for legal (being an attorney), I always wanted to know more about the technical side of what we were trying to achieve.  This course provided my first proper and thorough introduction to machine learning, not only the coding concepts but also the underlying maths.  It's been really tough going through the course, but that's down to my rusty maths (I have a maths A-level (i.e. pre-University maths to American readers)) and hadn't practised maths in around 12 years before completing this course.  Similarly my coding skills had become rather rusty.  All that said, the quality of teaching, forum support and coverage of this course has been great.  I've had to read around quite a bit, mostly where certain topics were introduced without first zooming out to explain what the overall algorithm is trying to achieve.  However, these issues were easily overcome given the course is well supported on the forums and similar topics are covered elsewhere on the internet given their prevalence today.  I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone interested in AI and machine learning.  I am looking forward to completing the Deep Learning specialization course as a result of this course, and will also be completing FastAi in tandem to get both a bottom up understanding (as was the case with this course, and will be the case with the deep learning specialization) and a top-down understanding (as will be the case with FastAI).  Thanks to the team at Coursera, the forums and Andrew Ng!",5
323,"My review concerns partially the course and partially the Coursera concept as this was my first on-line course and I cannot distinguish between those two.My experience was simply great, I felt that it was time well spend, for example compares to my company provided trainings and I'm hoping to return to another course.I have quite strong background in statistics so some parts were too basic for me but being able to speed the videos up is neat and it opens the course to wide spectrum of students (again opposed to company provided trainings or even school lessons where in the best case half of the students are bored of the slow tempo and other half isn't able to keep up with the same tempo). To have my own timeplan also helps but I even finished quite early as it was so fun.About the course contend: Andrew Ng prepared great lessons, all was pretty well explained (even when he cannot use some ""advanced math"" not to lose part of the students). The examples were illustrative as well as realistic (at least seemed realistic and that makes it more exciting than some artificial ones).I was little afraid of the programming exercises as I've never worked with Matlab (using mainly R). But now I'm glad that I know another language:) The system of submitting works perfectly.I can say similar thinks about the contend of the exercises as I wrote about examples in lectures. It is nice to program my own spam filter - the concept of programming only some small parts of the program and not to have to deal with data loading, plotting... is again very entertaining and instructive and then it can be done some nice application in short time.My thanks to the whole Coursera team and of course Andrew Ng. Hope to use this cool tools in my work. ",5
324,"First and foremost, I would like to remark on the following. Some of the reviewers below note that this course is a sort of ""waste of time because it covers only basics without going deeper into math"". Please do not take it too personally, but there is a ""Beginner"" level which is clearly stated in the course. I am not going to argue with those who already have some basis in Machine Learning or Math/Calculus/Linear Algebra - for these people it may be useless, no offense. In this case, YES, this course is too introductory but, again, it is for BEGINNERS! It is like, I am a person with C2 English certificate but will complain about the English course for A2-level-students. Please, keep this in mind. ",5
325,Absolutely fantastic course! I just wish my old university had classes on that level.,5
326,"This course is a great balance of practical implementation and theoretical underpinnings.  Very thoughtfully taught.  My only complaint is more of an issue with the Coursera platform.  If you run into problems, that in a physical university setting you could review in person with a TA, you can get help via the forums, but for the programming assignments in particular it is a challenge to talk to your peers about your problem, not violate the honor code, and still get to a point where you get your issue resolved so you understand how to complete the assignment.  For example, while vectorized solutions are not essential for this class, they are highly encouraged, and in at least one assignment non-vectorized implementations pay a significant performance penalty (hours of run time - possibly to find it did not work properly).  Ideally, in a physical college you could review things in person with a TA in a manner that did not violate the honor code, but did also get you to a true level of understanding.  The open, public forums are not a substitute for that level of help, and while the ""mentors"" are good, helpful folks, they are also volunteers with their own lives and also limited by the Coursera platform itself.  So that is the ultimate weakness with the Coursera format  I am not sure the best solution, and it did not overly penalize me, but I can see people (especially on the Neural Network programming assignment) giving up and not completing the course because they could not get the level of understanding that is needed.  I would still recommend Coursera, but hope as implementations are iterated the issue is addressed so that more people can get the help they might need.",5
327,"Andrew Ng's course is certainly a great introduction to Machine Learning for people who are unfamiliar with the topic. I think concepts were explained very clearly without much too much statistical jargon, while also familiarizing people with the concepts, techniques, and terms in ML. I do want to however suggest further improvements that maybe helpful for developing similar courses. I think first it would be better to teach the class in Python. While Python would have more of a learning ramp as opposed to Matlab for those who have never coded before, outside of scientific computing, Python seems to be industry standard and I would have preferred to be introduced to the environment, libraries, and tools in the course. Second area, would reiteration, depth, and practice. While the programming exercises did challenge learners to think, I think I would have gained a bit more for example doing an implementation of an algorithm from scratch and writing code to apply it in many different applications. Also, while mathematical proofs and derivations for formulas were impressively clear, I think it would be great to provide more sections in the course for those who were mathematically inclined to further explore the algorithm's derivation and see how it applies as the algorithm help predict a hypothesis. I think the course was well designed for someone who can't make to much time for the course, hasn't worked with high school and undergraduate college math in a while, and hasn't touch code or just dabbled in it. But it would be great to see a course taught as simply as this one, except with a bit more depth for those it might fit.",5
328,"The Machine Learning course taught by Professor Ng is a good way to survey a variety of the commonly used techniques in the field.  Though I had  been exposed to algorithms like k-means, SVM, PCA, and regression before, it was good to see a unified treatment of all the subjects.",5
329,"The lectures and reminder questions and tests and programming exercises were all fine I thought! I enjoyed engaging myself with the course material. I was happy not to have a lot of pressure. I was glad each week was a small enough manageable bite of work so I could get it done in less than a week with lots of time for other things, and still get done without being bumped to another session. I guess the programming exercises were very interesting because there are three or four sets of instructions and notations for each exercise: 1) course lecture notation 2) a PDF of instructions 3) the instructions in the comments inside of the overall exercise test code, e.g. ex7.m in Octave 4) the code itself in the exercise test code.  So after I learned to make a print statement in Octave I was able to figure out which way every matrix was pointed, and now I am an expert in fprintf again.  The most common example was usually the lecture notes had Theta(transpose)X while in the code I had to do it the other way.  I really enjoyed learning how to use graphs to tune the learning machine, and also how to analyze the pipeline to determine which part to learn on. I enjoyed the math in the course, like gradient descent of different types and the fminunc function. It all made a ton of sense to me and I think it can be a useful tool for me in the future if I am not too old or lazy or distracted to use it!  My first idea is to use the course techniques to create scrabble word study lists, I guess. Maybe to make a sloppy Valid or Invalid Word discriminator so I'll have a way to create phony vocabulary words or neologisms.",5
330,"There is always a trade off between various factors while designing any course, a lot of this has to do with the expected outcomes of a course and the intended audience for example. It takes a lot of thought, experience and a passion for communication and teaching to arrive at such a balance. This is one such course where I'd like to say that an almost perfect balance has been achieved, my sincere gratitude to Professor Ng and his team for putting all this together. I might have liked some more details about optimization algorithms and maximum likelihood estimation, but I realize that this is something specific to me and may not be shared by others who are taking this course for a variety of reasons. However, I do not mean this as a criticism, instead because I am so impressed by what Prof. Ng and his team have achieved, and since I also have a technical background together with a desire to communicate complex ideas, that at some point, if possible, I'd like to try and create and add this additional material. The reason for saying 'at some point in time' instead of' immediately', is that I now intend to go through some more courses on Coursera (I think I might be addicted now). While I have a technical background, it is not in computer science and I did not have a lot of programming experience prior to this course, yet this course has managed to give me a fairly clear and solid foundation in supervised and unsupervised learning together with some operational intuition on structuring machine learning projects. Once again, sincere gratitude to Professor Ng and his team for making this course, Thank you.",5
331,,5
332,"Never imagined online learning could be so much fun and so much in-depth. A lot of attention and effort has been put in to craft the training material including all the videos, exercises and quizzes so that every student can grasp the concepts with ease. The pace is excellent and the videos cover the foundation of what machine learning is all about. ",5
333,I came to know about this course while attending one of the webinar's on machine learning applications in VLSI design. I thought of exploring more about this topic and found this course. ,5
334,"Really an amazing and wonderful course for anyone who would like to dive into the depths of machine learning. I am a student who is completely from a very very different background. To be frank i didn't even expect that I could complete/understand anything about machine learning. But Dr. Andrews,.... sir hats off to you. You are the real hero. The course takes us straight off from the beginning to the end without any complications. You just need a passion for the subject, to learn, to understand. But i would also like to point out some stuffs to the course coordinators. The prerequisite asked is just basic programming skills, but i doubt is that sufficient. I had to spend hours and days for getting the programming assignments coded correctly. I would like to request the team to either include more working examples in the programming part or clarify the programming side in a better way. Apart from this the course is just superb! I also take this opportunity to thank Coursera community, the group of mentors and the entire team that works behind the scenes to make it such a big success. The discussion forums and resources provided (including lecture notes, programming tips, etc) are just beyond words. I sincerely thank a course mentor Tom Mosher for spending his time and effort for the resources and ideas he has provided throughout this course. To wind up; do not hesitate just take up the course if you have a passion for it. Thank you Coursera, thank you team Machine Learning and last but not the least hats off Dr. Andrews.  Good Luck ",5
335,Amazing course.,5
336,The course has 3 main strengths that help it stand out from some other courses I've taken (especially online):,5
337,Just finished the course. This is indeed an amazing course which can get started you in practical machine learning in less than 3 months. You will developing your own neural networks from the scratch. Below are the pros and not pros (i won't call it cons) that i experienced.,5
338,"Probably the best MOOC course on Machine Learning. Professor Andrew Ng is a great teacher - he makes complex algorithms and concepts very lucid and easy to understand, especially for people with no ML/ AI background.  The course is very well structured and gives useful practical tips. It does get quite intense at times, especially the vectorization parts in the programming assignments - but the Discussion Forums are a huge help. Many thanks to all the mentors, especially Tom Mosher for his guidance and valuable insights. Two small pieces of feedback - ",5
339,"A huge thank to Andrew (and the team behind him)! Amazing introduction to ML. Educational, inspiring and enjoyable. The best first step on the path.",5
340,"Dear Andrew, ",5
341,"The first thing programmers say when I mention Machine Learning: ""I want to do that, but I can't do/don't want to do/am afraid of maths"". Well, ML concepts are intrinsically linked with mathematics, no getting around it; this course, however, takes the intimidating parts and breaks them down into easy step-by-step explanations. It's as close to making the calculus simple as anybody will ever get!",5
342,"This course is brilliant. And yes just because its almost a decade old course doesn't mean the information is outdated or not useful. Infact, it is a complete opposite. This course is legend. At first I had the same feeling as should I start with this course... as many people recommended doing this before any other course. And it turns out that they were indeed 100% right.",5
343,"I highly recommend all of those who have data-related background, are extremely interested and fascinated about the topics of machine learning, and would like to start building their career in this field to attend this course as their first step. Professor Ng is indeed very knowledgeable and is also a great lecturer. Throughout this course he not only well introduced and led me through all the basic concepts and techniques of machine learning, but also illustrated all the important and practical tips for realizing a real-world project, which are aside from the techniques and can be easily ignored, but may save you a lot of time and efforts and guide you much more easily to a more proper direction of achieving your objective. ",5
344,"This is an excellent course by Prof. Andrew Ng. Learning from of the best in the industry has been truly an eye opening experience for me. Having a background with some level of software development experience, I have chosen to go with this course in particular (out of the many other courses that's available on the web) because I was motivated to not only understand how to use machine learning tools, but to get a concrete grasp of the theory behind machine learning algorithms, including concepts and intuitions. Short of going back to Uni to get this experience, I know there was a good chance Prof. Ng. would provide a similar academic experience in the course he provided. ",5
345,"Great hands on exercises and very clearly explained material. Was a bit slow for me I had to watch it at 2x: perhaps the simplest maths should be factored out into a separate mini course and assume a certain background for this one. The course is rather broad, though I was surprised not to hear once about Bayes or Markov (n-grams, HMM etc.). It might be a good idea to create a specialisation consisting of a separate basic maths part, all the methods presented here, methods applicable to bioinformatics and NLP too. And to top it all of Computer Vision. I assume the by-pixel techniques used in this course were just illustrating the points, as I would expect Gabor wavelets or something to reduce dimensionality and save ourselves from sliding windows (and rotations as a bonus). I am not sure if in this specialisation I would have liked to have all ""science"" points (how to run an experiment analyse results) separate from ""how to implement an algorithm"" and ""why the algorithm works"" or mixed in as this course does. I think either works. Some navigational infrastructure on coursera would be awesome (wiki style opportunities to jump around between ""aspects"" etc.). Finally, some summary notes would be very useful. When I do decide to implement any of this I will have to look through the exercise pdfs which are a bit long and at my code - perhaps, at the end, when you know someone has completed the exercises. Otherwise, the exercises are awesome.",5
346,"This class taught me a lot of the nuts and bolts of machine learning, and by the end of it, I am much more confident in building machine learning algorithms, or joining a team in doing so.  The instructor did an excellent job of explaining things slowly enough and in bite-sizes.  The programming assignments were very tough (especially because I have very little knowledge of programming languages and Matlab) but very valuable in the end!",5
347,"What a great course! I really loved the pedagogical arrangement of this course. Skipping optional but complicated proofs was a smart move for some maybe not so for a select few topics but I realize that they were necessary to make this class as interesting as possible, and interesting it really is, without a doubt.",5
348,"An excellent course that provides both a good overview of machine learning technology and practical exercises that help reinforce the technology. I found it a challenging course as it requires a good knowledge of vector and matrix mathematics, Octave/Matlab programming and some mathematical concepts that I've not used to this extent. The work is ably assisted by an excellent group of tutorials and mentors which help ease what was quite a steep learning curve for me. I can highly recommend this course to learn what ML is about - don't let concerns about the level of mathematics or programming stop you from at least attempting this course. You will need enough free time to view the lectures and undertake the programming assignments and the course timings are pretty accurate, although a couple of the programming assignments took longer than expected due mostly to debugging my Octave code (often stupid errors that took me time to find and test). ",5
349,"Outstanding course on machine learning fundamentals! A wide range of topics is covered in with a very carefully considered balance of understanding how the different algorithms work but at the same time not getting lost in all the mathematical details in the background. Although this means that you will not have seen all the mathematical proofs behind some of the equations that are presented (which would take considerably more time), it also makes for very effective use of your time if you are mainly interested in understanding the intuition of the machine learning algorithms and how to use them. Professor Ng has an incredibly clear and understandable way of explaining complicated topics, and his experience in the field shines through all the way. This course is not content with just throwing a bunch of equations at you but really conveys a very clear intuition about what they really mean, and gives a lot of practical advice on how to troubleshoot your machine learning algorithms, how to prioritise using your time in machine learning algorithm development etc. which is extremely helpful in guiding you on how to actually apply these algorithms to your own problems. The programming assignments are very well designed and will help you get practical confidence in making the algorithms work in practice (also the example applications are very cool and make it fun!) Thank you very much Andrew and all the course staff!",5
350,"I should have never hesitated to take this course. It seems to me that anyone who is serious about learning machine learning (outside of a more structured environment such as a university program) absolutely must start with this course. With a tenuous grasp on Python, I am still not ecstatic about this course's use of Octave, but as others have said, one should not be deterred by this. And even though this course does not touch on all of the significant ML methods (e.g., random forests), it definitely delves (a purposefully chosen verb, mind you) into perhaps the most significant. Of note, the transition from one-versus-all logistic regression to neural networks was masterful. And while the dive into neural networks was unexpected for an 'introductory' course on machine learning, it was tremendously gratifying to learn (more than just the basics) about something that has only grown more prominent since the inception of this course. To cut to it, Dr. Ng is clearly a gifted, fantastic instructor. The balance of mathematics in this Coursera version of the course was perfect. I loved learning the mathematical meat of the algorithms and, and the same, *not* having to grapple with unnecessary proofs and the like. I feel deeply privileged to have been able to work through this course. And I am excited that Dr. Ng has now released a new specialization on deep learning (using Python, no less!). Thank you!",5
351,"Great course. At the beginning, the of this course, I just want to learn something about neural network, but then I was fully attracted by this course. My major is biology but Andrew successfully makes me understand every point here. It is logical and understandable. It does not mean that it is an easy course, but reflects the elaborate work and deep understanding of Andrew. Now previous hard fields like computational biology and bioinformatics became quite easy to me.I can easily find out the algorithms they apply and know their shortages. If only I can know machine learning several years ago! ",5
352,"First off, I think the course content is amazing! I really like that the instructor used Matlab that encourages the user to create vectorized solutions to the problems. I have heard many negative comments regarding the lack of use of Python, R, or some other library like Cafe or TensorFlow, but I believe all of that should follow after having the mathematical background to understand these principles. The content is not easy, and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication, but not so much to lose me, and hard enough to keep me engaged. I really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one, for instance, linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural network.",5
353,"Absolutely top notch class - I would say this is the best class, online or off, that I have ever taken:",5
354,https://plus.google.com/102962854949157079552/auto,5
355,"Full disclosure: I am a mathematician, and therefore already well-trained in linear algebra, and I'm only 6 weeks into this course.  ",5
356,"I had always heard great things about this class during my research on what online courses to take next in my path towards becoming a data scientist. I was hesitant because it used Octave, a program I didn't think was going to be useful in my future roles. Then I completely bombed a phone interview in which they asked me the specific steps behind linear regression, and about gradient descent and the cost function. And I realized I didn't really know much about how these algorithms worked, although I used them in my day-to-day projects as a data analyst. So I finally decided to take this class, and after 11 weeks I can say that I experience WAY LESS imposter syndrome than before. I've still got a lot more to learn, but I'm confident that with everything Andrew Ng taught in this course, I will be able to hit the ground running on many other courses, with a thorough understanding of tools to use and the best ways to use them. In the end, Octave was just a little tiny component of a very scope of knowledge you'll attain after finishing this course. So if you're hesitant to take this course because of that, please don't be! I'm really grateful a course like this exists in a way that is easy to understand and is buildable. I'd consider this one of the best uses of my time outside of work, and I'd do it all over again now knowing what I have to gain from it.",5
357,This was my first on line course and the experience has been amazing. The lectures by Prof Andrew Ng were clear and the follow up programming exercises helped reinforce and enhance the concepts covered in the lectures. ,5
358,It is a very nice introductory course in machine learning. It teaches a good range of machine learning algorithms and good advices on how to implement them effectively. At the end of the course I feel like I am ready to tackle some machine learning projects on my own and I am sure many others who finished will too.,5
359," I
love this course. It's my highly recommendation to everyone who wants
to learn machine learning. Machine learning is definitely the
state-of-the-art topic, but it would be difficult to learn because it
combines the linear algebra, calculus, programming skills,
algorithms, etc.
There are tons of threads for learners to get distracted from the
main theme they need to focus on. That's why I am amazed by Andrew's
machine learning course. It's so amazing that Andrew just makes a
very complicated topic very easily understandable and very easily to
learn. What's more, whether learners have learned calculus or
programming or not, they can still easily understand the mechanism of
various machine learning algorithms even though some proofs of the
formula are not discussed. Moreover,
this
course does cover many
most
well-known machine learning algorithms. I
enjoy this course a lot and I am so eager to learn more in the last
few lessons. Thank you very much, Andrew. You definitely give me one
of the best courses in my life.",5
360,"Andrew Ng’s ML course is a great introduction to ML.  The course covers fundamental learning
algorithms in the right amount of depth for the student to gain an intuition
for mathematics and applications of the algorithms.  While the course can be completed without much
knowledge in either Linear Algebra and Calculus, to truly understand the
learning algorithms a solid foundation in both is necessary.  ",5
361,"Exceptional course. Demanding in terms of time required to complete properly, but worth every second. Future students beware: going through this course is a double-edged sword. You'll suddenly want to solve any problem you have at work/school with some application of ML. If this course is your first comprehensive introduction to ML then expect to utter the phrase ""...well now this changes everything"" on multiple occasions. Next thing you know you'll be buying books on Amazon trying to learn Python in your spare time so you can REALLY do some ML damage with all the importable libraries. ",5
362,Machine Learning from Stanford by Andrew NG is the cornerstone of online courses for Machine Learning - for multiple reasons. ,5
363,"An approachable introduction I recommend to anyone and everyone that at the least has matrix algebra under their belt. I took this with the intention of reviewing material, yet many concepts I had previously been exposed to were approached in such a clear manner that it felt brand new to me. I'm shocked at how much more clarity this course offered than my university! Moreover, it is absurd that I did a lot more work in my machine learning university course, yet never saw it pay off in an interview. This course was far less work (i.e. less time-consuming), but the pay-off knowledge-wise for interview questions has been demonstrably far far more time-effective. I highly recommend this course if you are limited on time and want a course to give you an edge in interviews. The big downside of this course is that there is no term project. In my case that was fine since I already have ML projects under my belt and needed to review all ML concepts at a general level, but if you don't have any noteworthy ML projects and are looking to dive into one, I'd still highly recommend this course (so many problems I can point out now with my ML projects in interviews for instance!!) but know that you'll want to move onto another project-focused course or a personal ML project after this for sure to get yourself ML-interview ready ;)",5
364,"This is by far the best Coursera (or any MOOC) class I've taken.  The production values are low, but the content is excellent.  Professor Ng explains everything very clearly.  The best part is the homework.  Each assignment is explained in detail and the assignments lead you in small steps to make measurable progress as each step is accomplished.  The 5-6 page PDF that accompanies each programming assignment provides all the information needed to fully understand what you are being asked to accomplish.  I have had MANY other MOOC's where the information in programming assignments amounts to a few sentences embedded in a Jupyter notebook and students are forced to search through numerous forum questions and answers to get an explanation of what you are really being asked to do.  Not in this course!  Everything is explained very well.   I might also mention that while most other machine learning courses are taught at a very high level, using Python and Scikit learn or other ML packages that do the heavy lifting, this course has you actually implement ML programs at a very low level, using linear algebra and vector math so that you really get to see how these higher-level packages implement the detailed algorithms.  No black boxes here.  I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning.",5
365,"First of all I'm so thankful to Andrew NG for this wonderful course and I'll always be in debt to him for this masterpiece. At the very start, when I was just starting out, I was really unsure whether this would be the right course for me as this is an 11 week course. I was also concerned about the usage of MATLAB/ Octave over Python. But choosing this course, I realized it didn't really matter given that you know how an algorithm is working under the hood. I love how Mr. NG has the special ability to teach such complicated topics with so much ease. I can never expect the same from any faculty I've personally come across. Yes, the programming exercises were sort of a pain but there are github repos that let you do the same in Python. What I've learned over these 11 weeks, I believe, is immensely valuable and probably very few courses out there are capable of that. This perhaps has  been one of the best decisions of mine so far. I plan on moving on to deep learning after this, thanks to Mr. Andrew NG.",5
366,"This is my first online course and I am so happy I selected Andrew's Machine Learning course as my first.  The material was well presented, provided plenty of information about why and how you should use each Machine Learning method and importantly he spends time time providing the intuition for why certain mathematical formulas are used.  The quizzes were challenging and gave you ongoing feedback on wether you were grasping the material in each section.  When you get one of the questions wrong it helpfully points you back to the appropriate material in the lectures to review.  Finally, I would like to thank Tom Mosher, a mentor and the author of most all the programming assignment tutorials and a constant presence and help on the discussion boards.  I didn't have to ask many questions but that was primarily because someone else already had and Tom provided the answer, often times within minutes or hours.  Even though I have little experience with online courses, the amount of support and attention to detail throughout demonstrates how good this course is and I can only hope is held up as a model for other courses.  Thank you Andrew and Tom.  I am truly grateful and can confidently say it was 10 weeks of work well worth my time and the knowledge that I gained will be used at my employer immediately.",5
367,"This is an excellent course covering the fundamentals of machine learning with a wide breadth of subjects as well as, in my opinion, a reasonable depth into each as well.  My only major qualm with the course (and this is just personal preference of what I would like to have learned) is that the programming language used for this course (that you must do the assignments in) is Octave/Matlab.  As Dr. Ng mentions in the class, Octave/Matlab is an excellent way to prototype your machine learning algorithms, and after having used it for this course I agree.  However, I believe it would have been much more useful  (personally) to do the programming parts in a more industry standard language for your final product such as python.  Point being, having completed the course I feel that before I can apply this as a final solution I must still learn how to implement these algorithms in a different language with different libraries, so it doesn't feel quite as if my journey is 100% finished.  That being said, I do feel that Dr. Ng gave a great mathematical understanding of the algorithms and I do not believe that it will be terribly hard to implement them in another language.  I believe the only barrier would be learning the Matrix Algebra and other ML related libraries standardly used in that language.",5
368,Hi. This is a great course which would be made even better with the small change I describe below. I was referred here by Nicole who was handling this as Support Case #1188060. I understand the mentors have been seeking this improvement for some time. Please let me know if I can clarify or assist in any way. Thanks in advance.,5
369,"Gently-paced and reasonable in terms of course work load, even for a busy person. This course greatly demystified machine learning for me. ",5
370,"This course in Machine Learing was challenging, but do-able... and very rewarding.  This is the first on-line course I've taken. It has been many years since my last formal college course, so I was a little rusty at the math (I'm 55 yrs old, ancient compared to my peers in this class. My last math class was over 3 decades ago, probably before most of my classmates were born.  Damn, I'm old). Even so, with Mr. Ng's teaching style, I was able to finish the course with both a good grade and - better still - a good grasp on the subject material.  I will certainly continue to pursue additional learning in this area.",5
371,"An exceptional journey through this vastly mind-boggling domain that is Machine learning. What a ride it has been! I must admit, before I started this course, I was pretty skeptical about it. Back then, Machine Learning seemed like magic to me. Only after this course did I realize that Machine Learning isn't as intimidating as it seems. In fact, if you have basic arithmetic skills, you can learn Machine learning to a very reasonable extent. Prof. Andrew Ng, hats off to you! You have cemented yourself as a role model for me since these past few weeks.",5
372,An excellent course.,5
373,"Amazing course. I'm on the founding team of a payments startup, where my role consists mostly of sales, digital marketing, and 'growth hacking'. At university I studied law so I had completely no knowledge of linear algebra or post-high school level mathematics, or programming. Yet I found the material digestible and engaging. At times the material was very challenging but I was usually able to understand after rewatching the videos several times and/or Googling alternative explanations. The programming exercises were not easy for someone with no programming background, but again, Andrew Ng did an excellent job of teaching the basics thoroughly and efficiently. The forums have some useful tips on completing the programming assignments in case you get stuck, which I did make use of occasionally. I did find that towards the end of the course, as I started becoming much comfortable with Matlab syntax and programming logic, I was able to complete most of the assignments without having to look for help in the forums.",5
374,An absolutely amazing course!,5
375,"
This course is suited for you If you don't have a background in Linear Algebra and Machine Learning.",5
376,"About me: I studied computer science in Dortmund, Germany in the 90ies. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to have a very good understanding of machine learning. A little bit of advice, if you have never learned linear algebra on a university level, you should at least try to get a basic understanding of it before starting this course. I was happy that I remembered stuff, learning it from scratch in 1 or 2 weeks would be difficult, I assume.",5
377,This is my first online course that I have ever completed and this feeling of completion is so immense! It took me one year to complete this. This was because I studied it part time while working and at the same time had other commitments pop in along the way. Nonetheless I'm really glad I made it through.,5
378,"This is really an amazing online learning experience for me! Thanks a lot, Andrew and your team! ",5
379,a. very good coverage of standard algorithmic approaches.,5
380,"The course specifically I rate at four stars. It's a great course, and I learned a lot from it. It's not afraid to get into more advanced details and mathematical underpinnings. The quizzes and particularly the programming exercises will challenge you. Professor Ng clearly knows his stuff. However, there are some serious flaws:",5
381,"The best Introductory Course on ML ever. No Pre-requisites allows anyone with the interest to learn ML learn it in the best possible manner. The course not only gives the Theory but also develops Intuition behind every algorithm which helps to retain the essence of the entire material. Not only the Theory but also the Practical Advices that the prof gives helps you to implement a ML Project from Scratch and Diagnose any possible error that may creep in, some of which aren't even used by many Industry Professionals. The prof is very humble and teaches you more like a friend, giving examples on how simple things may go wrong, also accepting that some of the concepts are not so easy to digest, so don't worry. The course is superbly organised which helps learners learn everything that the instructor wants to teach. The Quizzes, in-Lecture questions, Programming Exercises enable you to step through a path of- learning the theory, building the intuition, getting practical advices, implementing the code and inspiring you to work on your own projects. The Discussion Forum is always very active, you could clear any and every doubt of yours. Thanks and Congrats Prof. Andrew Ng on making the best MOOC ever!!",5
382,"Excellent course. You will learn linear and logistic regression, SVM, neural networks and many more algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) You will also learn about how to evaluate the algorithms and how to design a more efficient system.",5
383,"Professor Ng definitely is gifted in the sense of turning complicated concepts into reachable, comprehendible ideas, which is the best thing I can expect when entering this complicated ML world. ",5
384,"Excellent course. It has an easily understandable introduction and keeps gaining speed and complexity as you go on. While the first quizzes and assignments are quite easy, the later ones (except the final chapter) become a real challenge. I had to repeat some of them a few times. The additional resources are absolutely helpful, it's a shame I didn't use them until week 6 or 7.",5
385,"Exceptional. Andrew Ng brought a lot of himself in this class. He is a master of teaching complex topics in simple ways. I have learnt a lot from his teaching skill, in particularly on how to transform complex concepts into simple statements which is quite relevant in my job today. Not everyone is an engineer and yet many people around us have heard about ML. But many misconceptions are said. This class will help you make your message crystal clear. A big community has been growing up all those years and he deserves it. ",5
386,"Wow! What I can say! Thoroughly enjoyed a computer science subject with plenty of Mathematics.  And, that is at the age of 51.  I enjoyed going through each of the Video and the subsequent notes and quizzes. The quizzes took lot of time and needed reviewing the materials again, for most quizzes.  I initially struggled with programming exercises.  The speed and my familiarity with matrix multiplication increased exponentially and finally finished the last few programming exercises in no time.  ",5
387,"An amazing course! The lecture videos and slides are well-prepared and the concepts are explained by prof. Andrew in a clear and concise way, using neat graphs and plots when necessary. A lot of effort has gone into making the course largely self-contained. There's more focus on the application and practical implementations of machine learning algorithms than their mathematical and theoretical details (although not at all necessary, a fair exposure to advanced Linear Algebra - derivatives of multivariate functions, matrix decomposition, projections, etc. - can help in understanding some of the algorithms better). Lots of tips and tricks are given to help troubleshoot problems that often occur in practice.",5
388,A really excellent course.,5
389,"For the past few years, all I've been hearing is the word ""Machine Learning"" being thrown around. In my head, it was built up to be something really difficult that I had no idea about. I wanted to change that, I wanted to be a part of the conversation. This course has truly helped me do that, even as I go through more professional forums about machine learning, I understand the concepts a lot better. It's no longer technical jargon out of my reach. ",5
390,An absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. A great approach to teaching this material and making the student feel like part of the class right away. The contents were incredibly interesting and the structure of the course was absolutely perfect in my opinion. Andrew Ng. is a fantastic teacher and you can clearly see how passionate he is about this field from the get-go.,5
391,"This course was absolutely phenomenal. The main teacher Andrew NG made all the videos and classes so fast and seamless to watch with very interesting examples of real life, as well with important theoretical explanations. The topics, additional contents, extensions and real life cases were delightful to learn. The reviews at the end of each video made for a very fun and interactive way of demonstrating what you just learned in a video class. The reviews at the end of each sections were difficult at times but fair and rewarding when passed. The exercises were very difficult at times but the amount of resources, help from the mentors and the community and the general support to the students was more than enough to help me obtain a 100/100 score on each one of them. The only issue I would have is that the last few exercises were very difficult to understand. This meant that the code did almost everything and I felt like I did very little and that I myself could have not done what the code was showing me. But maybe it is tuned as close to perfection as it is. I can only say thank you and I really hope this helps me find a job as a Data Scientist.",5
392,"A really amazing course by Prof. Andrew Ng. He covered all the majorly used Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms. Now these things are covered by many other courses too, so what's so good about this course? The answer is Prof. Ng's lucid ad easy to follow explanations so much so that, you don't really need to be a wizard or even have a knowledge of College level Linear Algebra or Vector Calculus. Also what additional information we gain from this course is not just the Theory behind ML algorithms BUT also the practical implications! These things are crucial since most of us aspire to be ML Engineers in the applied space. He teaches us ways to debug our algorithms, practices which are industry relevant also how to improve performance of our algorithm, what to devote more time and energy resources to, etc. Just be committed to this course, you'll start loving ML and getting a hang of it in no time! Well it would have been ""another"" cherry on the cake if Prof. Ng had included other algorithms such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests and a much deeper implementation of SVMs, but overall, I'll rate the course a 5/5!",5
393,An excellent course. Very well structured and well paced. The quizzes and problems in every week have been extremely well thought of and provide a very good insight into the concepts explained in that week. The barrier of 80% for clearing each quiz and each week's problems is very good and important.,5
394,I am only 4 weeks in this course now. I am loving it!!,5
395,The best thing about this course is that it takes you step by step into the world of machine learning without overwhelming you. The initiation is simple and the complexity builds with each day and week passing by.  So when you look at the content you feel intimidated but once you get down to take a day/week at a time it actually unfolds pretty well.,5
396,This course is perfect if you are a beginner in Machine Learning and would like to get some gentle yet thorough exposure to the field.,5
397,"If machine learning is interesting to you then I would surely recommend this course. Professor Andrew Ng really makes it understandable and easy to grasp, honestly. I come from an economics and finance background, so I had some prior knowledge on linear and logistic regression, but I could easily see myself still understanding these topics and the whole course if I had not studied economics and finance previously.",5
398,"This course is one of the best courses I've ever taken, both online and in real life. This course requires no prior knowledge, meaning that anyone who has an interest in computer science, or particular, Artificial intelligence, can finish this course. I love how the programming assignment was designed and how such great so-called classmates have helped each other along the way. The mentors are very supportive. Before I started this course, I have no idea what machine learning is all about and what it can do. Then prof. Andrew Ng just made it looked so simple that I wanted to write the whole program by myself! The contents of this course are well-selected, not too easy, not too difficult, and of most importance, useful for everyone. I'm currently studying Medicine (I'm interested in BOTH Computer Science and Medicine, but I thought CS could be studied online) and found many potentials in improving the world's healthcare. I never regret spending my time finishing this course. ",5
399,"Awesome class. I took it while also taking Data science and Machine learning at my school. I felt like it was very informative and actually explained a-lot of material better than my school teachers. I like how Ng went above and beyond to not only explain what are the different types of machine learning algorithms available, but also tips and tricks on how to properly use them and also explain industry insight into these problems. The difficulty for me was not too hard, there are many hints sprinkled around some of the assignments, and I like how clear and easy Ng explains the material, and he makes the effort to explain things from the ground up and sets up reminders, which i think is very important. I recommend taking this class as a basis for machine learning, however more study is required to learn about more advance topics in machine learning such as Deep Learning algorithms: LSTM, Generative adversarial neural nets, convolutional neural nets, etc. Take a look at this course's syllabus for a list of topics that are covered and plan your courses towards the complete set of what you want to learn.",5
400,"This is the best college course I have ever taken!  I have a MA in Psychology with emphasis on Statistics and Research Methodology and ABD (All But Dissertation) for a doctoral degree, and this class was better than any class I have ever taken.  The lecture videos were organized, always on subject and extremely well done.  I used to nearly fall asleep in some of my graduate seminars, but had no such problems watching Andrew's lectures.  I especially appreciated the karaoke-like presentation of the videos + transcription.  I have always done better when having textbooks to go to and take notes.  With this approach, I was able to better process the information presented to me.  The programming assignments were challenging but not impossible, and the tutorials for each assignments always seemed to provide the necessary clues to find the solution.  And on completing the class, I feel that I have gained a significant amount of knowledge of Machine Learning, which provides me a bridge into a new knowledge domain.  I highly recommend this class to anyone wishing to learn the basics of Machine Learning.",5
401,"An excellent starter course if you want to start building your own ML systems and have a background in math. The course covers the high-level agenda and issues of developing and deploying ML systems in real life, while disbursing an engaging learning experience with a good amount of math and algorithms involved. The programming exercises are very well setup, helping you focus on the core learning for the segment. (Of course, setting up the problems is also a key part of the ML workflow, and you should try to spend time trying to do it yourself.) Centred around GNU Octave or Matlab, the course doesn't cover the applied aspects of real-time ML systems and deployments for server-grade operations, but it does touch upon the logic behind the MapReduce programming model for big data computing. Overall, the course was an excellent experience - challenging at times (rightly so), but fun throughout. Take this course in its entirety if you are looking to develop ML models as an engineer, and especially if you're looking to get up to speed with ML development as a part of product/portfolio management.",5
402,"Great class.  Much better than most I have attended in person.  Excellent instruction, excellent resources, excellent programming exercises, excellent support in the forums, especially by Tom Mosher.  Video is a much better medium than live lectures because of the flexibility, shorter segments, ability to stop and study something before going on, and ability to repeat when necessary.  Great practice in vectorization.  Excellent introductions to the necessary elements of ancillary topics. Bought the certificate. We live in a golden age for learning.  Getting this kind of instruction would not have been possible for someone in my situation 30 years ago. I am grateful and looking forward to whatever I learn next. 
",5
403,The course is well taught with clear examples and a good practicum. It certainly is worth your time looking into if you are (relatively) new to machine learning as it provides a strong basis. The practicum system submission and grading system works very well.,5
404,"This course was very nicely done. Dr Ng's videos and narrative were excellent. They were long enough to convey the material properly and short enough not to loose my attention. Assignments were very good as they left you just enough room to fail, learn and ultimately succeed. The quizzes were thought provoking. On the questions that stated ""choose all that apply,"" I would suggest that some form of feedback be provided so that the test taker could know which ones were incorrectly selected/not selected. Perhaps partial credit would be good instead of 0/20 with one wrong selection. Feedback, perhaps an explanation, would be appropriate on all questions incorrectly answered. ",5
405,"This was a very introductory course to Machine Learning, very well taught by a very experienced Prof. Andrew. I will recommend people to take this course to understand the working of various machine learning algorithms conceptually. Although, various proves like Back-propagation, PCA, etc. are not explained in this course, you will never feel like being not able to grasp any of the contents of the videos. I personally watched the videos at 1.25x and it just went as good as it would have been at 1.0x, except for saving the time and completing the course in 6 weeks rather than 11.",5
406,A truly remarkable course. Andrew is a great teacher and the course brought back memories of my University days.,5
407,"I want to deeply thank Professor Ng for everything he had taught me in this course. For me, in the beginning, I always knew that the only way to realize the dream of one day pioneering the AI industries and perhaps even help building the world of tomorrow of a Technology Utopia is through actually putting in the work into learning everything from the ground up. As a high student myself, though, these high-level, math intensive college computer science and AI courses like Machine Learning have always been intimidating to step into. Were it not for Coursera's platform and Professor Ng's genuine, intimate, and definitely extraordinary lectures and personality, I could not see myself smoothy entering the field this early and only have my passion ignited hotter than ever. Thank you, Professor Ng, I promise you I will continue down the path I chose, and regardless of difficulties and obstacles, I will push through, step by step, and just perhaps, one day, I will be able to attain that dream I still cling onto. When that day has come, I will remember my first course in ML and you.",5
408,Un cours excellent qui traite les principaux aspects du Machine Learning avec une ligne directrice sur la gestion de l'erreur et les différentes techniques qui visent à réduire cette erreur. NG présente les problèmes de réduction de cette erreur avec la gestion du Gradient et les différentes options pour éviter les minima locaux. Ensuite on comprend mieux l'impact des paramètres de régularisation pour la régression logistique ainsi que les spécificités des architectures neuronales.  Le cours nécessite un investissement certain en temps pour comprendre le contenu et préparer les exercices sous Matlab mais on apprend beaucoup dans ce cours même sur des sujets plus complexes comme les SVM et les Kernels. Ensuite pour ceux qui veulent mieux comprendre les traitements de l'image quelques exemples (ce n'est pas mon domaine). A la fin NB aborde le Big Data avec Hadoop et la parallélisation des traitements (initiation). Il ne manque que les approches autour des techniques d'Arbres (absence totale) et les réseaux bayésiens ou algorithmes génétiques. Mais c'est un très bon cours,5
409,"Can't say I am in any way not satisfied with the course, but here are a few personal feelings taking this course: 1. It is basically very straightforward to understand, although some part prof Ng takes extra time to care for some details, which I suspect for some students with solid math/stats foundation will find redundant, but indeed help those who don't a lot. 2. The algorithms introduced in this course are basic but also powerful, and relatively straightforward to understand too. 3. The programming exercises are very carefully designed to help students with the algorithms, while leaving the details of other programming components, which are very very very important to keep students on speed. 4. This course may require a little bit of Object-Oriented Programming language knowledge, and a little bit of calculus and stats to make the studies more smoothly. Thank you so very much prof Ng to have this course shared and this might actually turn out to be one of the most influential series in introduction to machine learning. - By some random fresher in the university",5
410,"This was a phenomenal dive into Machine Learning! I will admit, not having a strong mathematical background, I struggled throughout the course, feeling like I was bobbing up and down, just managing to keep my head above water regarding some of the linear algebra involved (although the option linear algebra review unit was extremely helpful and much appreciated). That having been said, Professor Ng did an excellent job of not only teaching popular Machine Learning algorithms, and how to implement the same in either MATLAB or Octave, but he provided a wealth of practice advice for debugging and fine-tuning those algorithms as well as when and how to use them in real-world applications. This was my first course in Machine Learning and I enjoyed it very much, in spite of my struggle with the math. (I actually feel motivated to take some remedial math classes, i.e. linear algebra, statistics, and calculus in order to better understand the math behind these fascinating algorithms and to gain more comfort with what they actually do). Great course, invaluable information!",5
411,"Great course from an expert in machine learning. It felt like the right amount of math - not so much as to derive everything from scratch, but enough to understand how the underlying algorithms work - what cost is being minimized, how gradient descent is used, etc. The programming exercises were quite good as well...not super easy but not too hard. I was initially skeptical of the choice of matlab/octave (rather than say python) but in the end it made sense. There is a lot to be said for grappling directly with the vectors/matrices and seeing things like how the weights are applied, how the sums can be vectorized, and similar ""closer to the metal"" aspects. Another terrific aspect to this course is that there is a fair amount of material on how best to apply machine learning, in terms of training, cross validation, test sets, understanding bias vs variance, learning curves, and understanding in general where to focus efforts next in a machine learning problem rather than spending months on something that would give minimal gain. In summary, well worth the effort.",5
412,"This is an excellent survey course in Machine Learning for anyone who isn't an expert already. It moves at just the right pace to keep you challenged without being overwhelmed. The staff are very helpful, and the professor makes sure to get his point across before moving on. In fact, if I had to offer only one criticism it's that sometimes he will repeat the same thing over (many many times), which is unnecessary and thus sometimes frustrating because we have seek bars and speed control for the lectures. ",5
413,A really good course for an in-depth overview (is that an oxymoron?) of machine learning. ,5
414,"Extremely well done course! Every video carefully explains the part of the concept being introduced. Whether its the derivation of a concrete formula, such as gradient descent, or a qualitative concept, such as the vector support machines, the tutor's explanations are always very clear and concise. I like that a lot of different ideas are covered, and even though I have a mathematical background, this course doesnt require it, since the most mathematical parts are left to the interested reader while the focus lies on the applications. A very beginner friendly course, all you need is some basic calculus and probability theory. Also , if its too easy for you: the notes of the actual Stanford University Course (!!) can be found in the materials section of the course, so you can ""play the course on hard mode"", too. That Stanford version is a lot more mathematical and difficult. All in all a very very good course, and I'm happy I tried it. I would probably do every course done by this tutor, he is that good of a lecturer. Coming from a maths and stats lecturer, btw.",5
415,First of all I'll like to thank Andrew Ng for the great initiative of putting together such a brilliant effort. Our society evolves due to special people such as him. Great guy!,5
416,"This course is an excellent introduction to machine learning. Credit goes to Prof Ng for making a complex subject so simple. He made it easy for people without mathematical background to understand the concepts behind the various algorithms. The course covers the core algorithms of machine learning in adequate depth. That level of depth is required to get a good understanding of the concepts surrounding an algorithm. What I find very exciting is that after completing an assignment, one can use the code to solve any problem outside the assignment set. I found it very exciting to use the algorithms to solve external problems including those on Kaggle.",5
417,"There's something about this course that keeps you focused video after video, lecture after lecture, quiz after quiz and assignment after assignment. Maybe its the way in which the course has been put together beautifully with every topic coherently completing one another. Or maybe its the beauty in which every concept is explained so that students can understand and visualize what is happening. Or maybe its  practical examples and case studies that complement the topics discussed. Or maybe its the interesting yet challenging programming assignment that when completed makes you feel accomplished and keeps you coming back for more. Or maybe it's all of it. ",5
418,Good starting course for machine learning topics.,5
419,"For someone with basic math and calculus skills, I won't lie it was quite the task to ramp up,  I was intimidated at first (Legendary Stanford), but you just gotta use google to figure out the holes.  I will say that I wish that there was a lot less ""hand-holding"" for the assignments, but without it, I probably wouldn't  have finished!  I would recommend doing it with a friend for motivational purposes, as if you fall behind, it's really hard get caught up.  It's A LOT of time to invest.",5
420,Prof Ng has boosted the amateurs confidence in Machine Learning. ,5
421,"I think this is a great course. So, before going on with the review, thank you Andrew, you're a great teacher. I've found everything you tough us very interesting. We should thank-you because I'm sure you're also a very busy person and still you find time to teach this amazing field of machine learning to other people.",5
422,"Я благодарен автору этого курса! Благодаря курсу я ознакомился с концептами машинного обучения! Мне очень понравилось то, как Andrew NG подает материал. Он связывает понятия через аналогии, понятные на интуитивном уровне. Курс стал для меня дебютом в машинном обучении. Теперь я знаю о существовании многих алгоритмов машинного обучения и в будущем, уверен, смогу применять их на практике. ",5
423,This is my first experience with an MOOC and I thought it was awesome and I'm sad it's over. If Professor Ng created any other ML courses I would sign up instantly. I also found it really easy and super beneficial to take the homework data sets and objectives but do them entirely in python using pre-existing scikit-learn where possible. ,5
424,"This is an excellent course!! It has amazing Professor and teaching team. It covers main topics in Machine learning. The coding exercise is funny and not too hard. You can find all the useful information on forum and teaching staff. The structure of this course is also terrific. Some people said it would be better to teach this course in Python. I also have the same feeling in the beginning. After finishing this course, I would say that Matlab/Octave is the best option.",5
425,"This course teaches you as much about machine learning as it does about the technique of teaching. Prof. Ng took very complex topics and explained them in an easy to understand/intuitive way. I took a lot of different statistics courses in my life and I do have an analytical bend of mind. But no one has taught as lucidly as Prof. Ng did. The programming exercises (and the associated comments in the code) help you to refresh the concepts that you just learned. When you see the outputs of your efforts in a picture or a graph/chart, it makes you feel good; having accomplished something. Though I wish the course has been taught using Python or R that seem to be the languages of Machine Learning, I strongly recommend this course no matter what skill level you have. The tutorials and the forums are highly useful as well. I almost feel a little lost that this course is over as I was looking forward as to what comes next including what color shirt Prof. Ng is going to wear for the next lecture. Learning is definitely fun. Enjoy the ride!!!",5
426,"Must say this has been an eye-opening experience for me! The content itself is very well structured and it for me at least this was an excellent introduction to ML concepts, and I found this to be a very appropriate level of depth - detailed enough to get one's hands dirty and learn by doing, but also allowed the course to move at a fast pace without getting bogged down in any one area. ",5
427,It's a little bit outdated but covers what you think are going to be the essentials (plus a lot more essentials that you didn't think about) really well. Good pacing. I'd have preferred a python/numpy set up for the programming topics but actually you learn a lot about details of matrix/vector manipulation that you would never do with something like scikit learn.,5
428,"Very manageable amount of knowledge gained per week, though I did take more time to finish the program. I dedicated week hours and weekends to this class and enjoyed the learning process which always felt like I could finish by just putting in the time. I was fortunate enough to have extensive Matlab and programming experience as well as exposure to high levels of math (incl. lin alg at a top engineering college) which both definitely helped my progress. When I was wrong, the program helped me see where I was mistaken and the notes (PDFs) were definitely useful to study from and summarize our learned topics. The programming was definitely hard, but the algorithm explanations definitely helped. Not an easy course, but simple and straight forward. Completed about 3 weeks over time including one week of full vacation on my part (much needed though and allowed the knowledge to sink in). Andrew is a nice and effective professor, but listening at 2x is a must! 1x for non-native speakers is likely. Excited to start the next course!",5
429,Very good course on machine learning. Prof. Andrew is a very good teacher and I look forward to taking more advanced / specialisation courses in machine learning taught by him.  ,5
430,"Thank you Andrew Ng for making this such a wonderful course , Looking forward to your next  Deep learning.ai specialization. With lots if respect thank you sir!   ",5
431,"Great introduction to the principles of machine leaning and its core algorithms. Do NOT let the Octave/Matlab dissuade you - while I'll likely never use it for real problems I think this was a good choice for teaching and playing with a new language was kinda fun in itself. I would've liked to see Decision Trees in the curriculum, and sometimes I felt the videos ran long on easy concepts and went through important points too quickly, but I also recognize everyone has different priorities and backgrounds. This course strikes a good balance on those issues.",5
432,"Excellent class to gain a broad overview of the field of machine learning. I was already quite familiar with data analysis and linear algebra. The teacher is great at breaking down complex topics and give progressive step-by step understanding. The math notation is very lightweight and I would have liked a more expanded linear algebra context. However, it was quite easy to connect the course material to a more formal linear algebra approach and I enjoined doing so as a side during the course.",5
433,"I completed my undergraduate degree in economics. As much as I love the mathematical rigour of economic models and and theory of economics I found econometrics much more engaging, practical and able to deliver more value for others. I studied advanced econometrics like binary models, truncated models, EV and so on and having found machine learning & data science I feel that this is a natural extension for me to pursue a big interest of mine.",5
434,"Andrew Ng is a boss when it comes to teaching. Throughout the course, he has simplified the machine learning concepts to a point where they can't be simplified any further without losing their mathematical basis. ",5
435,"Outstanding course! Andrew is an exceptional teacher, making difficult and complex topics easy to understand. The course is very well structured in a way that there are no questions left unanswered and you can have a really in-depth understanding of the topics by just watching the videos and paying close attention. I have a degree in electrical engineering, so it was quite easy to follow the course. But I believe that even people with no programming/engineering/mathematical background would benefit from this course, because Andrew makes it easy to understand the concepts and the algorithms formulations. The programming assignments really provides a good practical approach for all the theory given in the video lectures, and the code templates are very well structured to enable even someone with no background in programming to complete the tasks. The functions used and implemented can then be adapted for implementing your own machine learning problems. Overall, great course, I am very satisfied with it!",5
436,"Hi Coursera,",5
437,"I found this class easy and fairly interesting. I do have some math/programming/Matlab background, perhaps that's why I found the class easy. I didn't have any machine learning experience before taking the class (except perhaps knowing what a linear regression is), so it's a bit hard for me to judge the quality of the content. ",5
438,"Excellent course for any ML started. I like the hand-holding approach to programming which doesn't scare one off who has little knowledge of programming. Basics are cleared in efficient way. To borrow from Quora ""I believe Ng’s course is especially to-the-point and exceptionally efficient, so it is an extraordinary acquaintance for somebody needing with getting into ML. I am astounded when individuals disclose to me the course is “excessively fundamental” or “excessively shallow”. On the off chance that they reveal to me that I request that they clarify the contrast between Logistic Regression and Linear Kernel SVM, PCA versus Matrix Factorization, regularization, or gradient descent. I have talked with hopefuls who asserted years of ML encounter that did not know the response to these inquiries. They are for the most part plainly clarified in Ng’s course. There are numerous other online courses you can take after this one but now you are for the most part prepared to go to the following stage.""",5
439,"Course ""Machine Learning"" cover all main topics of macine learning and describe algorithms very clearly. After the course you will feel that you are AI and machine learning expert. However, this is introductinary course and I believe seperate course can be created for every topic, algorithm and method covered here.",5
440,"Excellent course, was very interesting and helpful. As with any course, I have a few suggestions:",5
441,This was my second course in ML. I took it with the aim of gaining a deeper insight into some of the fundamental topics and I was not disappointed. The professor Andrew Ng teaches the concepts in a way that is easy to understand and reason about. I loved the pace and the way the material is structured. Quizes and programming exercises completed the lectures very well to give a more complete picture of the topic at hand. Actually some of the quizes and specifically programming exercises are quite challenging. This is actually a good thing as the lectures alone would make the course a bit boring and without any practical application examples.,5
442,"This class was a great introduction to machine learning ideas and implementation. Prof. Ng does a really good job of not only showing you how to code up machine learning examples in MATLAB/Octave, but explaining the rationale behind them. If machine learning is as much an art as a science, then this is the ""artistic"" part, which is hard to find in a textbook.",5
443,Thank you very much to Andrew Ng and his Team for this very interesting course. It is clearly a great way to get a good background on Machine Learning.,5
444,"Professor Ng has been working with machine learning R&D for more than 10 years now and have seen the significant phase of evolution of this field before it gain its popularity. Undoubtedly, AI and ML is going to be ubiquitous and impactful in many creative forms in the coming decades and I'm very fortunate to not only gain such an in-depth intuition and  understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning, but also to gain the confidence needed to articulate these concepts and theories with Prof. Ng's guidance. The difficulty of this course is average. Quizzes and programming exercises require solid understanding of the concepts and also a lot of patience (just because you don't understand a particular concept, doesn't mean you're dumb. Give it some time and perseverance and you will pull through). Thank you Prof Ng and Coursera for this course. I would recommend this course to be the first stepping stone if you're going to venture your life in to the world of Artificial Intelligence!",5
445,"I found the course very interesting and informative. I wanted to learn for a long time about Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Artificial intelligence etc. so the course in Coursera came in a good time during the COVID-19 quarantine. The videos are explained in a very good way by Dr. Ng. Slides are extremely useful. The question/quiz is helpful to digest the information and the programming exercises are done in a very good way in order to implement the acquired knowledge. I will probably spend more of my out-of-work time in Coursera in order to learn more about implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning which are the next two subjects of interest. A final note: since I am using MatLab in my daily work as a researcher in academics I found no problem in implementing the exercises also in somewhat more advanced vectorized way from the earlier exercises. Many thanks for the excellent course and a nice interface for remote courses such as Coursera. Dr. Nimi (Nimrod) Bachar ",5
446,Andrew Ng is such a great person and teacher! This course is just pure gold and this is my first MOOC.,5
447,"This is the best course for machine learning beginners. The best. Andrew explained many fundamentals very well and it is not just one algorithm that he focused on but he wanted the students to understand how to debug and how to improve and optimise. These ""strategic"" stuff are probably more important than the hardcore ""tactic"" algorithm stuff because students will have a better understand about what they are learning and why they are learning this, more importantly what they shall be learning in the future. I would like to thank all the efforts from Andrew and other mentors on course for developing this fantastic course. If you really want to pick some bones from an egg i would say that probably provide a python version of this course would be brilliant. For the same course assignment, in matlab the codes should be this and the codes in python could be this...i know this will put so much much more work on the course developers but  you know just a small suggestion. Thank you Andrew!!",5
448,"Profession Andrew NG has a quite indepth knowledge in the Field of Machine Learning and he covered almost all the topics in very great detail with the approach of creating basic building block of the Machine Learning of any individual. Although, sometimes I felt that professor deep dive into too much derivatives and mathematics but after completion of the course, I realized that all those stuff were necessary for creating a foundation of the subject. ",5
449,"I graduated at UCL in London, my PhD was in Electronics Engineering, far from maths and computer science. Machine learning is a very interesting topic that I have always loved to explore. By coincidence I became a data scientist working in London where machine learning was needed. 2 years after I first come across Andrew Ng's coursera video lectures, I decided to finally go through all the modules and get the certificate. Not native to Octave, but I am glad that I have learned it for the assignments and now feel very comfortable on applying it. Today, I have finally completed this course, after spending many evenings late after work staying in my work office's meeting room to study. Many thanks to Andrew and all the examiners in this course. A special message to Andrew: I have recognised your appearances on TV and blog posts documenting artificial intelligence, I wish you every success, and I secretly wish that one day we would cross paths with each other. ",5
450,"This course is an opportunity to get acquainted with several machine 
learning techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), anomaly detection, non-supervised 
learning (clustering, K-means, etc), recommendation systems and very 
interesting discussions about batch/mini-batch versus stochastic 
learning and large-scale learning systems. It does not require a deep 
knowledge in algebra and calculus (although a solid background in 
mathematics surely helps a lot) and progresses in a logical manner from 
easy, standard techniques to advanced ones. ",5
451,"This course is really really really amazing for me! Andrew Ng is a great lecturer. There are 2 main parts here, the maths and the intuition. Most of the time, the class talks about the intuition and the reasoning, i love it. The reason behind that is you can take a more advanced course about machine learning or deep learning afterwards with a good intuition about the algorithm. But, the math is not so little, too.",5
452,"Fundamentals well explained, solid programming exercises complement the theory giving us an opportunity to see the theory in live implementation. Contemporary solutions like recommendation systems, e-mail spam, image recognition and long standing regression/classification techniques are well balanced. Advice on practical implementation of ML applications is the highlight. Over all it is well designed and delivered. However, it approaches more from mathematical/engineering stand point, whereas in business world it is approached more from statistical analysis perspective using co-relation, R-square, p-values, error function following normal distribution etc. Some linkages between the two approaches may help us become more productive at real life work. Almost entire course focused on classification problems, except the first exercise that deals with house price forecasting. May be few examples of regression with the same algorithms also can help matching the needs of enterprises.",5
453,Andrew Ng's passion for the subject of Machine Learning is obvious and infuses every lesson. His wide experience in the field allows him to enhance the video lectures with tips and examples that help him to explain what are often quite complex concepts.,5
454,A fantastic opportunity to get a global overview of one the most exciting topics of data science.,5
455,"Just completed the course myself and I have to say this is a great course for anyone who wants to get a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning.  First of all, the content of the course is very well structured.  It covers a lot of machine learning algorithms and also includes a lot of practical applications.  Professor Ng is very gifted in teaching and he can explain some difficult topics in very simple terms.  I also found he is very engaging and the quick questions inserted in the middle of the videos are very helpful to keep the students focused on the lecture.  The programming assignments are at the right level of difficulty, and I found the instruction for each assignment works like a great summary of the corresponding materials.  Didn't use their discussion forum much, but for a couple times I used, the mentor was able to respond in a very timely manner.  Overall, this is a great course and I am so happy to be able to take it myself.  Thank you, Professor Ng!",5
456,"I came in with no background in linear algebra/octave/MatLab, and machine learning always seemed like this black box to me. This course had some challenging sections, but is totally doable for someone with a limited background, if you're willing to put in the work. The lectures simplify the concepts into little, manageable pieces,  and the programming exercises reinforce the concepts learned from lectures (these exercises also have detailed tutorials to help those out that aren't familiar with the programming languages used in the course). Dr. Ng has an amazing ability to teach without jargon, and being overly technical. His final video, and mannerisms throughout the course, make it clear that he is a compassionate instructor that really wants to inspire his students to learn these concepts. Some of the ideas behind machine learning are now much more clear to me and I look forward to learning more, and using more current implementations of machine learning e.g. w/ python.  ",5
457,"Very helpful course that taught me the basic principles behind the field of machine learning and its various applications in the world. Mister Andrew did a great job teaching, and his love for the topic made the whole experience even more exciting for the student. The videos were short and straight to the point with various questions and quizzes that constantly held the attention of the student and helped him keep his focus, while the programming assignments gave a very good intuition about the practical use of machine learning principles in real world problems and helped the student gain a first- hand knowledge about machine learning application programing. The tutorials were very useful and the mentors replied to my questions very fast, giving me the help I required while working on an assignment. I thank Andrew and the mentors for helping me embark on a journey towards the world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, robots and technology. A great course indeed.",5
458,"A practical and engineering minded introductory/overview course to machine learning. It has set the scope of the subjects right, it was wide and deep enough to be able to understand the basic ideas, how to attack the problems, the type of thinking needed for solving problems with machine learning, how to plan the work, where to spend more time/energy, how to implement efficiently, how to measure performance and progress etc. The choice of Octave for the programming assignments proved to be excellent. It was fast to grasp its concepts and very efficient both at writing the programs and running them. The videos are transcripted, the slides were well explained, they are available for download, the resources section contained the summary of the lessons etc. All in all there's been a lot of progress from the first Coursera courses many years ago. The Coursera app (Android) was surprisingly good and useful, I preferred using that for watching and I used a browser for the exams.",5
459,  I've been utilizing my free time to learn the concepts of machine learning and their applications and successfully completed the Machine Learning course offered by Stanford on Coursera.Professor Andrew Ng is a great teacher and this course is both challenging and satisfying. The course is of 11 weeks and some weeks have two sets of lectures. So there is a little more effort required in this course than any other ML courses but is great value for the time spent.This course gives a grand picture on how ML works by focusing more on the basic concepts as opposed to focusing on specific components like programming language/libraries which most of the ML courses available on the internet suffer from.What I loved the most about this course is how the instructor(Andrew Ng) always mentions the correct way of doing things and how things are done by a few people in industry. Overall this is a very good course which gives a solid foundation in the basic concepts of Machine Learning.  ,5
460,"Fiz o curso em 2020. Sou estudante de Economia (já tinha uma base boa de estatística), tinha um conhecimento básico de programação e conhecia um pouco de Machine Learning. Na minha opinião, Andrew Ng tem uma boa didática e é muito bacana aprender com alguém de renome na área. O curso serviu para dar boas noções de ML, tornou o assunto muito mais tangível e deu um panorama interessante. As tarefas de programação me tomaram um bom tempo e tive algumas dificuldades mas consegui completar tudo com alguma ajuda. O programa utilizado é o Octave (ou Matlab). Não foi difícil me adaptar a esse ambiente. No entanto, me parece que a escolha de software pode ter ficado um pouco ultrapassada, talvez seria mais interessante em Python. Não sei dizer o quão difícil é adaptar o código e as bibliotecas. De qualquer forma, isso não afeta a explicação dos modelos de ML  ou mesmo os conselhos e boas práticas apresentados. Não tenho base para comparar com outros cursos de ML disponíveis.",5
461,"The positives of the course are: Material presented was clear, and concise, not a lot of fluff and thus very efficient. The pace was just right for absorbing the material and to write some notes. Besides the excellent delivery of the material, what really stands out about this course for me and why it is so awesome is that there was strong coverage of methods to use to avoid possible pitfalls (underfitting, overfitting, types of problems that each learning method is suited for, how to decide on spending extra effort gathering data or not, finding which component in a pipeline is worth trying to improve and avoiding wasting effort on components that don't improve overall results). Other courses will often present a range of different methods but have little or no guidance on how to use them correctly and avoid pitfalls. Anyone can use a tool but often it can make a big difference in efforts and results if it's used correctly. ",5
462,"Thank You Very Much, Andrew Sir. I feel the scarcity of words to express my gratitude and thank you to you, Sir and the Coursera. The course is very well designed and enables a novice like me who has little prior exposure to the field of computer science to understand the concepts of Machine Learning, pass the review exercises and programming exercises. I think a little improvement could be if more videos related to Mathematical concepts (for example something relevant to Support Vector Machine)  relevant for this course are included in the course or authentic links or (esp. Mathematical) resources are provided which students can refer to sharpen their mathematical concepts which are relevant for this course. Thank You very Much, Coursera for providing me financial assistance. I guess without the financial assistance, it would have been hard for me to enrol to this course because I earn very modest from my current job. Thank You Very Much Coursera and Andrew Sir. ",5
463,"Excellent course. I have no background in math (save for a good understanding of linear regression) but professor NG's teaching is so good I was able to follow along quite well. I knew I would eventually be working in python, so I personally elected to forego the assignments in matlab/octave and found a resource online that had all of the finished assignments in python which I simply studied and commented until I understood them. I would recommend this approach if you are simply interested in getting up an running quickly and know you will be using python. I would also recommend watching the videos at 2x speed to save time.",5
464,Prof. Ng is such a good teacher that he explains things in a proper way to make you understand. ,5
465,"As this course is rated, and according to the lots of opinions written about this course, I can only add a new congratulations remark to their creators. Andrew Ng is not only a genius who masters all the contents, he is also really didactic and teaching. Andrew is able to boil the more complex concepts (e.g.: neural networks) in simple explanations with very illustrative material and an updated approach to real examples and use cases like (autonomous drive or Photo OCR and text recognition).",5
466,"Excellent course, Professor Ng teaching approach works very well for complicated but fascinating subject. I always found his lectures to be clear and concise regardless of the difficulty of the material. I also found the programming assignments to be a valuable tool to enhance understanding of the material.",5
467,"I learned a lot from this course. I recommend any beginner (like me) or a professional in this field may try this course, because ",5
468,"This is probably the best Machine Learning course out there. The course covers up everything in Machine Learning, right from the basics to the complex parts. Even though I had studied some Machine Learning at college, this course helped me learn many new concepts that I was previously unaware of. The instructor Prof. Andrew Ng is very good. His explanations and examples are simple, yet cover up all the details. The course structure is very good and the assignments are well prepared. The course also gives a tutorial on Octave / Matlab basics and helps develop your logic and coding skills in the same, through programming assignments. The course material like the Lecture Slides are very useful as well. This course not only helps you learn Machine Learning, but it also helps you develop the intricate details used to implement Machine Learning in daily as well as industrial applications. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Machine Learning.",5
469,"You can learn everything about machine learning from the very basic things to the now omnipresent product recommenders and spam removers such as Amazon's and Gmail's. The course consists of lots of short, 0-15 minutes, lecture videos and programming assignments, so you can see them at your intermediate times though you will need a certain amount of time to complete each assignment, which would greatly help you understand how they work and make you feel like you could make your own algorithms yourself. Don’t worry about the programming environment. You can see how to install it on your computer, either Mac or PC, in the course. In my case, I’ve completed all using Online Octave, in which you can run your program without installing anything on your machine because it runs online though the computing power you can use is limited. Anyway, I truly appreciate Andrew Ng, the creator of this course and the co-founder of Coursera, to give this great opportunity. ",5
470,"It has been a great learning experience taking this Course. I am currently taking an advance version of Machine Learning in my school, and this course on Cousera has definitely provided me the basic and essential  knowledge in tackling more advance machine learning problems in school.",5
471,"Professor Ng provides an extremely accessible overview of AI techniques. The math does seem a bit imposing, but anyone with a background in pre-calculus or higher should be able to ""get it"" if they sit down and work it out. I took a similar course at the University of Texas in the 90s and this was presented in a much more understandable manner. It might have been beneficial to work on a complete AI programming assignment at some point, or at least accomplish more of the coding, as most of the assignments required completion of the more trivial aspects of the technique. Also, I was a little surprised that search (tree traversal) was not addressed. Maybe that's too old hat, or covered in a graph course. There were some frustrations with Coursera not working correctly (unable to submit assignments due to broken URL forwarding, broken Latex rendering which is still not 100% working), but I really like the site when it works. High marks for Professor Ng!.",5
472,I reviewed many courses before taking this one and I'm sure that I made the right choice. This course covers the underlying mathematics of how the various learning algorithms work. Understanding at that level is essential to designing and debugging machine learning systems rather than just applying rote techniques or blindly calling library functions in an ML framework.,5
473,"Fantastic. Andrew Ng is a naturally charismatic teacher with a knack for anticipating issues which his students may encounter and assuaging them before they become sticking points for later understanding. By their nature, online courses cannot benefit from students asking questions of their instructors so it is doubly important that instructors be aware of areas which may confuse students and take anticipatory action to avoid this- this is only one of Ng's strengths. Beyond this, Ng is simply an enthusiastic instructor whose passion for his subject is contagious. He also conveys a genuine sense of understanding the student's process of coming to grips with more difficult portions, often explaining what has confused him before (though, given his expertise, one may wonder just how much these areas actually give him difficulty). All things considered, the biggest disappointment is that there are not more courses available with Ng as the instructor.",5
474,"This was a very helpful introduction to machine learning. The instructor's explanations were very succinct but always rigorous. He provided insight wherever possible. There are some optional videos explaining much of the underlying mathematics - and even when there were topics  where some of the math was beyond the course of the syllabus, professor Ng made it a point to provide references. (I especially appreciated this as PhD student in mathematics myself). I always think it is helpful before learning a new technique to ask 'How is this applied in real life?'. I can confidently say that Professor Ng made it a point to answer this question with every new topic that was introduced. The assignments and readings are very good at helping you become truly comfortable with the material taught. But they are never too tedious to be discouraging. Not only did this course teach me a lot - it also piqued my interest in the subject. 10/10, would recommend!  ",5
475,"First of all - thank you very very much to Andrew Ng !!! There are some things which can be improved - as always but in general, I think it is perfect. I am a hight Energy Physicist and I have some reasonable good knowledge of mathematics. Some of the explanations are so good and so clear that I would use them while explaining quartum mechanics ))))))) and this is not a joke. I was inspired by Andrew Ng and had read partially (not entire) the Ph.D. thesis of Andrew Ng. Thank you one more time for all the algorithms you have explained here. Thanks to you I have: 1) my own spam classifier with my own dictionary - for this, I use bash and  c++ library,  2) I have my own list of movies and I make these lists for friends :-) !!!!! 3) and finally, I have the vector components of my face and faces of my friends in the space of celebrities )))))). I wish you and your closes surrounding to keep healthy happy and focused on the things you like to do !!!!",5

477,"Andrew Ng is an outstanding instructor.  This course takes a breadth-first approach, first glossing over the details to describe how various ML techniques are used, then coming back to describe how the underlying algorithms work.  This approach worked very well for me.  The intermixing of video lectures and straightforward programming exercises worked well to cement the concepts.  I have a much better understanding of the ML domain than before I started.  Over the past few years I have read a number of books attempting to come up to speed in the fundamentals of machine learning, but I found each lacking, either going too deep into the underlying mathematics before describing how various techniques could be used, or providing only surface level descriptions with no real world examples.  I am so happy that I finally put the time into this class, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to come up to speed in the fundamentals of machine learning.",5
478,"This course is very well organized and exposes students to some fundamentals of Machine Learning and practical applications of them. Assignments and guidance to complete them from resources, tutorials and test cases are absolutely helpful to learn these basics and their application with an hands on approach and gives students much more confidence on what he is learning and has been able to absorb. There is a lot of complex materials covered in this class which at the beginning looked fairly insurmountable but working the Assignments with help from resources in form of tutorials, test cases to run and of course the very valuable forum discussions and moderator Tom M's continuous help made learning a lot easier than I thought. Finally thanks to Prof Andrew Ng for offering such an well organized course like Machine Learning through video lectures, lecture notes (pdf) and exercise files to make learning more meaningful and much easier to absorb.",5
479,"I always had the interest in learning about ML topics in general, because of the unlimited capabilities of powerful algorithms that make possible the processing of data that, for us humans, results generally in something non-comprehensible, but it brings out marvelous results from scratch! This course offered me not only the opportunity to increase my abilities with matrices development in OCTAVE/MATLAB (and many, but more many ways in that it is possible to do calculations with a focus oriented to a tremendous performance), but in essence and most relevant, the right path to learn something of so much utility and admiration (and to be honest, very complicated at beginning to get familiar with) in such a high-skilled professional manner for explaining all involved themes. Every scenario must have a context in order to be understood, and this course accomplish with it at utmost level. I assure you will be very satisfied with these lessons :)",5
480,This is an amazing course for anyone looking to get into ML & DL. ,5
481,"Firstly, I will like to say THANK YOU! to Mr. Andrew Ng. For putting in so much work and effort into such an amazing online program that provided me on a great introduced into Machine Learning. ",5
482,"Great content and explanations.  Exercises guided hands-on efforts through all of the major algorithms and concepts, including very useful tools such as training rate analysis, cost and gradient descent verification, etc.  Exercises were well structured to focus on key concepts - i.e. didn't have to spend a lot of time sweating the details of loading datasets, plotting results, ...  The code I take away is an excellent foundation with which to explore other datasets with confidence.",5
483,"Before taking this course, I took the Coursera Applied Data Science specialization which included a higher level view of ML and applications to NLP and Social Networks.  That series did not delve into ML algorithms but focused on the application of ML libraries and understanding the some of the different learning classifiers and regressors.  This course is an excellent complement to that specialization, the former gave a broader view of the landscape, and having that training, it gave me much greater understanding of and appreciation for what these algorithms were doing.  It stretched my non-software background but I was able to learn enough to effectively complete the programming assignments.  I know the whole machine and deep learning field is complex and challenging, and for a novice like me this is not going to turn me into an expert (as Prof Ng suggested) overnight, but I feel like this gave me a solid footing to further pursue it.",5
484,There is a reason this course is so well regarded!,5
485,"Very good introduction to machine learning, Andrew is a great teacher, always clear and slow enough to be able to follow everything in detail (sometimes even too slow). I like the little questions in the middle of the explanations and the quiz, well thought and almost always touching very important concepts that could be overlooked. Programming exercises are well designed, I never had problems understanding the assignment or submitting my code. Just one side note: most of the code is already implemented and sometimes there is very little the student has to do (literally 2/3 lines of code). It would be great if students had more ""freedom to fail"" and figure out how to fix their code. However, I realize this would be less appealing for most of the students.After all, great course, I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in the topic without previous knowledge! I am going to take the deep learning specialization courses now!",5
486,"An incredible introductory Machine Learning course! Everything you need to get started with developing Machine Learning systems for practical applications. Programming exercises provide a solid framework for creating your own ML algorithms. Videos are to the point and give all the necessary mathematical background without going too deep into the theory behind the mathematics, but just enough to create the working implementation of the algorithm at hand. Quizzes during the videos and at the end of the week help to solidify the newly learned concepts and techniques. The lecturer, Andrew Ng, deserves a medal not only for creating this course, which has probably been a lot of work to begin with, but also for clear explanations and overall, for being a great mentor throughout this wonderful journey. What can I say, I can only wish to take more courses by Andrew to learn more about the subject and gain even more expertise on the subject!",5
487,"Till I jointed this course, I thought ML was one of the toughest to learn and not the for the guys like me, who is out of Math for a decade. But the way Andrew Ng, takes this course forward,  it feels like easier than learning how to code for finding prime nos. Yes, I am a big fan of Prof. Andrew Ng, and already consider as my ML guru. So much motivation I got from this course that, I have already started taking his Neural Network and DeepLearning specialization course from coursera. He mastered the art of teaching tough concepts in easy to understand methodologies. With 95% passing grade, I can confidently recommend this course to anyone. ",5
488,"Firstly, I would like to thank Coursera and Professor Ng for making this course available for people like myself, who have been observing recent shifts in the information technology industry from within. It has allowed me get to know, albeit at a very basic level, the machine learning algorithms being used currently in the industry, and also take beginner steps towards being able to implement them using a programming language.",5
489,"Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand what machine learning is about. This is by far the best teaching material available online that I know as an introductory class to machine learning. I know some python programming and very little C before taking it; I tried to read the codes on Kaggle website to understand their projects, but only found myself not understanding anything when it comes to data analysis with machine learning. My friend recommended this class to me and I am glad I spent three months to study it. Never done any matrices calculations before, but it is not hard to understand it; and I have forgot most of my college math (major in basic science research in the past), with some help (online and friends' ) again that's not difficult to understand the content either. Now I am excited to learn some more advanced machine learning skills and hope to do some projects for practice. Thanks for this great course!",5
490,"The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material, which can still be understood by non-CS students. It's very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB/Octave programming assignments. After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions. Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture. I still don't have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain, but it feels like the course doesn't miss anything of the fundamentals.",5
491,"Had high expectations prior to taking this course because of the rave reviews. This course truly exceeded expectations. Andrew Ng explains ML concepts in a simple, intuitive manner. He tells you exactly what you need to know, and yet he provides optional videos for students who are more mathematically inclined. The programming assignments are very well-designed, and serve to reinforce understanding of key topics. I also appreciated the nice balance between theory and practical aspects of ML (e.g. how to debug, pipeline of a ML project)",5
492,It would be easy to rate the course with anything below 5 stars for it being not enough formal and academic; for explicitly not requiring prior knowledge of basic calculus and algebra; for using MATLAB instead of actual industry standards.,5
493,Machine Learning by Andrew Ng is one of the best courses I've ever taken - hands down. ,5
494,,5
495,"Excellent introduction to different methods in machine learning. I have some prior experience with machine learning, and although this is an introduction, it gave me a lot of good tips for implementation, debugging and workflow. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the different concepts in machine learning and when to apply the different methods. Questions during the lecture videos and quizzes afterwards keeps up your attention, and the programming assigments make you understand more deeply how to implement and apply the methods on real problems. The programming exercises are mostly pretty easy if you have some experience with programming and matrix/vector multiplication, and some of them are really funny to play with and apply on your own data or pictures afterwards. The lecturer, Andrew Ng, is also very good at explaining, and you never feel that he jumps over unclear details. I highly recommend this course!",5
496,"Machine Learning was just the right amount of challenge for me, and really forced me to think both analytically in terms of what algorithms and programs are doing, and holistically/strategically, giving me some tools to anticipate common problems in machine learning system design. I do believe having a bit of background in mathematics and a beginner's grasp in programming helped me in the beginning, so if you don't have this knowledge, just be prepared to spend a bit more time on the material as well as brush up on some theoretical basics, such as linear algebra basics and sums/derivatives. The estimated time for completing each week of the course doesn't include the homework, which I found to be the most practical, useful, and challenging part. I would allocate 2x the estimated course time for each week if you include the homework assignments, unless you're already fluent in matrix multiplication and programming.",5
497,"This course is a great introductory course on Machine learning. You don't need to know much math as everything is taught to you; if you know some basic calculus then you're fine but again, you don't really need to as it is explained. Having an introductory background in linear algebra is an asset but not a requirement. Specifically it helps to know something about multiplying matrices and the resulting dimensions but all of that is taught in the course. Give yourself enough time with the programming exercises and read the discussion forums first before attempting the exercises because they provide clarifications in some cases. I strongly encourage taking notes because you'll refer to them constantly during your programming exercises. If possible do this course with a friend so you can have weekly discussions about what you've learned, can support each other when needed and finish the course on time. All the best!",5
498," I majored physics in undergraduate and now majoring Artificial Intelligence in graduate course. I was having tough times getting through this new realm that I don't know very well because I was studying this for just hobby. The knowledge that I learned before was only from some articles and books without any practice but through this course, I now have organized concepts of what machine learning is and how they are used in practice. Many of you might have trouble with python because numpy is quite tricky library to use with start. But intuitive octave code made me successfully focus on the course topics not on manipulating numpy.arrays(because it takes so much time to do that). Last video was impressive because Andrew said he also had hard time studying this field and I'm totally related to that. Thank you for nice video and thank you for making me feel that I'm not alone in this field. I'm really appreciated! :)",5
499,"It was a wonderful experience completing this course. The review questions present inside the video, the quiz and the Assignment, All these together made the journey even more interesting. It boosted up my confidence that I am getting the things rightly. Few times, Programming Assignments created obstacles as it was not accepting our code which seemed all right to us but as they said, the code needs to be correct for every type of data. So the assignments when completed, used to make proud as well. For help, there are many options available as test cases, mentors. ",5
500,"Great course. Really enjoyed watching and listening to Professor Andrew. The course material, quizzes and programming assignments are of very high quality. The programming assignment may require some time and effort if you don't have programming experience. I am a software engineer so It was relatively straightforward for me. The programming problems were very good to reinforce the leanings and it was enjoyable to see the code you write working on real-life solutions. The mathematics is not too heavy if you can remember junior college matrix algebra and a little bit of calculus. The course does not expect you to know in-depth details. The course covers a wide variety of machine learning basics in a short, concise and effective way. I notice, ""concretely"" is the most often used word in the lectures and it follows with a practical explanation of how to apply and implement the concept learned. Great job, Coursera.",5
501,"Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers I've ever seen. Serious and direct, but also accessible and very motivating. Thank you so much!",5
502,Amazing course! Well worth the time. Opens so many possibilities and springs so many new ideas! Andrew is a great instructor explaining very complex concepts in extremely simple way.,5
503,"I found this class to be excellent. Professor Ng presents the materials in an approachable way that goes into the mathematical intuitions of the topics. As always further mathematical study (in this case specifically linear algebra) would be helpful, but for the length and scope of the course there is an excellent balance of mathematics with practical usage. I also found myself agreeing with the notion that Matlab was useful as a prototyping tool (a view I didn't initially hold), and I use it for that on my own now when the situation warrants it. I personally would've liked an overview of the tools for these types of algorithms in any of a number of programming languages, but I can see how that is not really the focus of the course, and with the fundamentals gained from this course transitioning to other tools should just be a matter of familiarity with the tools, rather than the algorithms they implement.",5
504,This is a great course ! The pacing is just right. Andrew covers each topic in very easily digestible bits and is very careful to not overwhelm beginners. I find this technique incredibly refreshing and open and welcoming. It is all too easy for professors to act like elites in their ivory towers and make you feel foolish for not knowing enough but Andrew is the opposite of that and actively encourages you to push through difficult topics by focusing on the high level details first and leaving it up to you to research the details on your own.,5
505,"Excellent primer. Would recommend.

",5
506,"Excellent course, perfectly paced and detailed. The professor Andrew Ng succeeds in creating a comfortable atmosphere and is easy to follow.",5
507,"This course has definitely provided me with the necessary theoretical knowledge of the concept of Machine Learning. It is not difficult at all if one has a good grasp of linear algebra, statistics, probability, with some experience in MATLAB/Octave programming. I always find it more useful to set the foundations right with first principles, before setting off to using more advanced tools and libraries that tend to operate as black boxes. ",5
508,"Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course was an excellent learning experience. The course was well organized and pedagogically sophisticated.  The combination of hands on exercises, quizzes, and lectures made the course enjoyable, engaging, and easy to learn and retain. I believe that Professor Seymour Papert would approve of the methods in this course.  The exercises provided the students with the opportunity to interact with the material. By providing a framework of well designed code, with the task of writing the core concepts on our own, students could focus on the important things and simultaneously learn from the expert and optimized code provided. We were expected to use vectorized implementations, which enabled us to both think about the problem in a mathematical way and write code that is efficient and scalable. This course is a Machine Learning classic. Thank you Professor Ng and tutors!!",5
509,Many thanks to the professor Andrew Ng for his time and effort to make these videos.,5
510,First let me thank Professor Ang for all the effort he had put in. My over reaching objective was to get ,5
511,"A fantastic hands-on introduction to machine learning.  A very good balance of theory and math with the hands-on aspect.  The math, when it goes into calculus, is there for the interested student but is optional.",5
512,"Incredible course, introduces so many machine learning concepts flawlessly and leaves you excited for more, Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher and it's been said before, but I will say it again, he definitely has a knack for explaining complicated concepts in an easy to digest way. I completed the course in about six weeks (if anybody's wondering, because I know I was), in those six weeks it was about 26 full days of work with assignments and everything (yes I kept track), but realistically you should spread out the information and absorb it over time so that it sticks long term. I already have an engineering background (electrical engineering to be specific) and had taken courses on Linear Algebra, Statistics and Probability Theory so the math he points out seemed familiar, but if you're looking for an introduction to machine learning and the various terms associated with it, this course is for you!",5
513,"I thought this course was excellent.  I am a 62 year old geologist and have seen my profession move quickly incorporating machine learning methods.  I do not have a goal to be a programmer in ML but I do think it is important to understand the usability of ML as I am concerned about its misuse particularly as applied in geoscience.  This course met my goals.  I found this course to be challenging and I think it is best to have some background in matrix algebra and programming, which I have, but without these fundamentals I think the course would be more challenging.  However, I think there is a lot to be gained by just listening to the lectures.  This is still a beginner level course, however, and no one should expect to be an expert after this course, but it is a good jumping off point to pursue the topics in more detail.  I thank Professor Ng for his efforts and clear explanation on this topic.",5
514,"Before starting this course, I know only a few concepts in Machine learning but after finishing this course, I know how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to problems such as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. ",5
515,"This was one of the most interesting course I ever took. It was long time pending, I started it but in initial days I was discouraged as I was not able to match the mathematical understanding even I after having engineering background and took sometime to brush those concepts, but after some time and some reading I was able to understand. I was putting hard efforts and after 3rd week it was more difficult in doing programming assignments, which again took some time to learn and the cross this difficulty level. Overall it was great experience and great learning. I can't believe this that I reached till end. The course was ending but my interest and curiosity was increasing everyday. Even sometime I was dreaming the problems I was trying to solve and overcoming those challenges. It was amazing and throughout I enjoyed this course. It is totally mind blowing and  addictive one. Thanks Mr. Andrew Ng.",5
516,"Acabo de terminar el curso fue un viaje fantástico en algo
que en verdad no conocía, pues no tenía conocimientos de programación (a decir
cero),  en el primer ejercicio de programación
dije hoo!, y comencé a buscar tutoriales de Octave en internet, demore 3
semanas en entregar el primer ejercicio, mientras avanzaba en el curso me instruía
más en Octave, hasta lograr nivelar las semana  y hoy terminar el curso.",5
517,"The course provided me a very good concept of Machine Learning. The practice exercise are very good intellectual training for the understanding of the course materials. However, one must put some effort into it in order to get in-depth understanding of the materials, searching on the web for extra info for help to clarify the concept is necessary. Dr. Andrew Ng is good lecturer but a bit shy. However, learning with him is a pleasant experience. Because after this course, I found other similar ML course only repeat the very very basic concept with no details of how is done like that (just use the formula etc.). But this course is only focus on machine learning other that that; like cleaning data, remove unnecessary parameter, deal with missing value etc. are not the purpose of this course. I sincerely recommend this course for those who would like to know the ""WHY"" to participate in this course.      ",5
518,"This is the course through which I started my journey with machine learning. I am really grateful to the Machine Learning community and specially Prof. Ng for making this course and the curricular available to so many students including me. I learned a lot from this course and beside this course helps me to think and dive into the deep of ML. Though I completed this course and got my certificate but no doubt I am surely going to miss this course. But I already started my journey with Prof. Ng once again  with his deep learning course. Once again, I am thankful to the Coursera community, the Machine Learning community, the discussion forum members and last but not the least Prof. Ng for their tremendous effort, support and providing us the platform to learn  and implement the crux of Machine Learning. A recommended course for researcher, self-learning student, industry personnel related with AI.",5
519,"This is an exceptionally good course where I learnt the fundamentals of machine learning in detail. The coding assignments ""concretely"" helped me commit these concepts to memory, give one a hands on feel for problem solving and it's just awesome to see your own work. The course is a little rough at the start. Once the coding assignments become more image based though it becomes easier to understand and visualise things.",5
520,"Dr. Ng is an incredible instructor!  The lectures meticulously lay out the math required and the instructor provides encouraging comments along the way.  I was not looking forward to the math in this course but ultimately is was not only straightforward, but addicting!  I started working a little ahead, then farther and farther ahead.  I actually started wanting to spend all my free time on this, doing all the optional work, and taking the example code and expanding upon it for my own experiments.  And now I have finished the course in about a month, and I am genuinely sad it is over.  Why couldn't I have been this motivated about my classes when I was a university student years ago?  Probably because Dr. Ng wasn't there!  Great course.  Excellent instructor.  Lots of resource materials when you need them.  Ex4 is a bit difficult and time-consuming but all the rest were very fast to complete.",5
521,"I will never be able to thank Sir Andrew Ng and team Coursera enough for this opportunity. Sir Andrew Ng is truly a genius. I have learned a lot here not just technical skills but also way of thinking and approaching problems in general. I feel like growing up as a person here, and that's how machine learning also works. Isn't it? I'm a bioinformatics student, so I needed this skill. I've already started thinking of on how I can apply these algorithms on biological data to solve problems in genetics. Lastly, I'm convinced by others that this is the best course on machine learning. I'm not in a state or position to review all the efforts you guys have put to make such complicated looking course so simple. For those who are new to machine learning and thinking of doing this course, please do it without any hesitation. Blessings to all of you, and I wish you all luck for your future projects. ",5
522,"Excellent introductory course on Machine Learning, even for people who don't know a whole lot of linear algebra. One can do this course in two ways: First is to look through all the pre-existing code in the test exercises and really understand how all it works and the second is to only focus on the portions that the course expects you to finish. Just finishing this course would not make you an ""expert"", but this is a very well structured course to get basic concepts firmly rooted in-place. Since this way my first foray, and I am not a good programmer, I was looking to focus on concepts, which this course truly enabled.   ",5
523,"My graduate ml-introduction course professor actually recommend this course. I only focus understanding the exam math and concept at the time. This course gave me a solid refresh and a better general explanation on some of the doubt I can't help to clear before. For the programming assignment, I saw people who give 1 star review complaining that it doesn't teach you how to do it end-to-end. For me, the simplicity and moderate depth actually help me to  unveil the mysterious mask of ml, which is a pretty big deal for me. This programming assignment itself essentially just ask you doing one thing, that is vectorize calculation. But that doesn't mean it only teach you that alone. I skip most of the peripheral code. And I think for a start of implementing end-to-end, those peripheral actually give you a good sense of direction what else you will need to go in depth and implement yourself.   ",5
524,"Absolutely fantastic course. Professor Ng's approach to teaching is a bit more top-down, so you'll get a lot of useful theory and intuition about how the different Machien Learning algorithms presented in this course actually work. Do not expect to be terribly fluent in implementing these algorithms after completing this course, though. I found that the programming exercises really show their age and although I recognize that Matlab/Octave is a nice programming language to implement matrix operations, I still feel that having to use this language is the weakest part of this course. But there is no single course that will teach you everything you need to know about Machine Learning. Considering the huge amount of intuition I've gained, I feel like this ""11 week"" long journey (it certainly took me longer than that!) was one of the most elevating educational experiences I've had to date.",5
525,"This class is a basic course in Machine Learning - ""basic"" as in foundational, not as in ""too simple"": ""basic"" as Linear algebra and partial differentiation are ""basic""; however deep knowledge of these aren't required for the course. Dr Ng is a superb teacher, and provides everything needed for even novice programmers to acquire a ML foundation. Before taking this, I started watching his older Stanford CS229 videos (still available) and they too are excellent - covering some topics more in-depth, but they did not come with graded tests or programming exercises. Half way through I started a Hinton Coursera course in parallel and quickly exited; I found this course much clearer & more accessible, and the programming work I found to be both rewarding and reusable. After each week I had an intense desire to actually find a relevant real-world problem and apply the current lesson to it.",5
526,"I give my highest recommendation for this course. Among my other courses within mathematics, statistics and computer science this will be my number one course before all others. Since I grew up, I have admire the universities in USA and this course is a prove by that. Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng and the mentors, I have managed to complete the course within Machine Learning and gain more insight of computer science. After this 11 weeks, I believe, I will mainly remember the course moments of Neural networks, the applications of Logistic regression and all hard work for vectorized implementation in Octave to complete the programming assignments. Besides this and that the course was given online, I will also associate that this course was given during the time of World Pandemic. Once again, Thank you for all advices and the excellent course. ",5
527,"This was a very enjoyable introduction to and overview of machine learning, from the perspective of someone who doesn't want all of the detailed mathematical justification for the machine learning algorithms, but does want to see the nuts and bolts of how they are implemented. For example, we don't prove that we have the partial derivatives of the cost functions (or, even, really justify what partial derivatives *are*), but we do see how they are used as the input to gradient descent routines which let us optimise systems such as linear regression. It is an ideal course to use as a springboard for different aspects of machine learning, such as the Neural Networks course which is also on Coursera.",5
528,"I am impressed by the tender and empathic way that Andrew uses to explain the material. It is a pleasure to listen to him and learn with him! In addition I am very thankful to the people that put continuous effort to improve the programming exercises and answer the questions of the students, so that we can walk through the exercises focusing on the main concepts of the course - you all made a wonderful job! ",5
529,"I graduated from college last year with a math degree without a ton of programming experience; I'm working as a developer now and I've gained a lot of confidence with my programming ability, but I hadn't quite found a good way to satisfy my curiosity about machine learning algorithms. This course was taught incredibly well--relatively accessible while being comprehensive enough to satisfy my curiosity in situations where I wanted a bit of a look behind the curtain at how these things really worked (which is the issue with many articles/tutorials online--either they plop down equations without giving you a shred of intuition about how they work or they go right into the weeds). The workload was of course lighter than it would be in a typical college course, but honestly I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I learned and was able to retain in this course. Thank you!",5
530,"Andrew NG's style of teaching is so charming and all the lectures are extremely well thought out and structured. The course load per week was also perfectly designed in terms of the time it took. The quizzes and the programming assignments also gave a lot of insight on how to program machine learning applications. This course is perfect for beginners in machine learning. Andrew NG teaches everything from the start and doesn't dwell to much on advanced math and covers the requisite math pretty well (but for those who want to go in depth, he offers an insight into the concept behind it so that you can google it for yourself). If you are interested in data science and looking to start a career in the same, this course is for you. Thank you Andrew for introducing the vast and wonderful world of machine learning and data science to me and countless people all over the world!",5
531,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Andrew Ng's lectures. He mastered the art of teaching complicated concepts (stat and linear algebra stuff, ML is notorious for) in a simple and clear way. I loved the graphs, 3d visualizations throughout the course material. I specifically loved the real-life neural networks example (a simplified version of self driving car video) shown in one of the lectures. This course is designed to equip students with not only the foundations of machine learning but to ignite a genuine interest and love for the field, which is a really important goal for any course. The programming assignments, review materials and discussion forums, all provide tremendous learning around the concepts taught in lectures. I would suggest every student taking the course to thoroughly understand course materials even at the cost of extending your course session to a later one.",5
532,"Wonderful course! Andrew Ng has a way of helping you grasp the
intuition of Machine Learning material whilst giving substantial
leads into the more technical aspects. His vocabulary appeals both to
the aspiring statistician and the amateur enthusiast. One ends with a
thorough picture of the subject, from motivations of a Machine
Learning problem, to the mathematics of regression & neural
networks, to algorithmic implementation with good habits (clean code,
vectorization, parallelization, etc.), to practical advice on error
analysis & effort distribution. The 'coding' homework is
gratifying : for pedagogical bits of code entered, we are
rewarded with a graphical display of Machine Learning at work.
Furthermore, every technical concept is introduced or illustrated by
a clear, contemporary real-life situation or simple 2D example that
sticks with you. Thank you Andrew Ng!",5
533,Taking this class was quite a challenge as I took many different classes on different platforms in preparation for my going to grad school.,5
534,"Beautifully organized overview of basic concepts and applications in machine learning.  The instructor is skilled at communicating an intuitive understanding of the algorithms and the essentials of how they work.  He covers the key ideas while avoiding getting bogged down into mathematical and technical complexities. He provides diverse examples showing how the ideas can be applied to big datasets, images, spam filtering, robotics, website traffic, etc.  The course is enjoyable and entertaining.",5
535,The course was extremely beneficial for me. ,5
536,"Andrew, a big 'thank you' for teaching this class! Even though I DON'T consider me as an (real) expert in ML now, I got a thorough understanding of many many topics of ML. Prepared with an arsenal of algorithms and a lot of great advice I feel ready for take-off. The course has been teached in a perfect order, explaining not only the mathematical underpinnings (luckily not in depth) but focusing on the intuitions,  rationale and use-cases behind the different algorithms. The many given examples (lecture and ready-to-run-code in exercise) have been very motivating and inspiring. ",5
537,I am Wondering  Before I Don't know how to Implement Recommendation Features and Suggest Products On Home Page as Much Targeting the User We Have done Lots of Effort and Design More Complex Database tables and Structure but i but we did not Mining The Correct Data as per Users Views and Choice Thanks To This Course it Help me more and more in Redefining my Programming Technique and Think To Move through the Artificial Neural Networks and NLP For Getting More Relevant Search dataset collection For Targeting More and more users and thank to you also Coursera team and Respected Prof. Andrew ng He is Delivering an very Nice Tutorial Session and Bunch of Assignments which is actual relevant and Genuine Example which are Understandable to any new student who Join this course and Thank you for this course forum moderator also they are really nice .,5
538,"The course is really well structured and easy to follow if you have basic knowledge in any language programming language. Basic concepts of probability and calculus might also be handy for understanding some of the proofs or derivations, but are not needed at all to follow the course. I particularly liked how you get to implement some ML algorithms yourself and see them in action. It is also worth mentioning that the programming exercises just prompt you to complete the key parts for each assignment, so you don't have to code everything from scratch. For example, for the problems, you are usually given the functions to load and visualize the results, and your task is to implement just the logic for the task. One thing that could be improved is that after week 6-7, there are no lecture summaries after each video, which I found very helpful during the first weeks.",5
539,"I am primarily working as a PhD student in Neuroscience. I came to this course with mostly biology background and some decent, although not extensive knowledge in maths and stats. The course has been absolutely fantastic. All the topics were very well introduced and developed. I was really astonished and pleased how well Andrew Ng was able to explain the concepts clearly and comprehensively, without sacrificing rigour or depth. He goes into enough detail in the math to give you a thorough theoretical grounding without assuming tons of knowledge and for the more advanced students points out relevant topics they could explore further if need be. I think this is an excellent introduction to machine learning and I would highly recommend it to any student in Computational Neuroscience/Biology or anybody really who wants to know more about ML. Andrew Ng is the best!",5
540,"""Why should I learn programming? What is it useful for?"". This, this is what it is useful for, regardless of the area you're working on. While I don't agree with Octave/MATLAB being the most beginner-friendly platform, when Python is the prefered language for machine learning, Andrew Ng succeeds in giving a great overview of most areas of machine learning and how easy it can be to begin playing around with it. He goes on not only to explain how to use these algorithms, but also teaches the important metrics which, while not fun or glamorous to talk about, can save you tons of money and time and allow you to get much better performance in your applications. Overall, I'll reccommend this course to absolutely everyone who wants to learn Machine Learning, even to people who don't know how to program and were asking themselves ""Why learn and where should I start?""",5
541,"Extremely enjoyable course. Professor Ng really takes the content down to an understandable level by focussing on conceptual ideas over the mathematics (which is still interesting, though would probably be better learnt independently or at universities). As a maths student myself, I got a lot of value from this course's introduction to all the main algorithms used in machine learning and how to best apply these tools. Although the course is quite introductory in terms of difficulty of the maths/programming exercises, it is very comprehensive and well worth the time for any beginner with a decent mathematical background (some knowledge of 1st year university maths). I also liked how MATLAB was used to simplify the programming and it was obvious a lot of effort had gone into writing the MATLAB guide scripts. Would definitely recommend this course to my friends.",5
542,"A lot of effort, passion, and time went into the creation of this course. The fact that it is made freely available is a testament to the dedication of the persons involved to share and spread knowledge for the larger benefit of society. The course material is presented slowly, with many repetitions and many examples, so that literally everyone with even minimum higher education and programming skills can potentially take this class. If you have good upper level education and programming knowledge you can easily follow the course at 2x speed on the videos. The quizzes and programming tasks are easy but still make you reflect on the main parts of the curriculum. In the end, the course provides a great overview of the main tools of machine learning and presents some interesting applications, making it a perfect starting point for your education in this field.",5
543,"Going through the whole process, I really think that this course is a strong introduction (and  sometimes more than just an introduction) to the machine learning field. Andrew gived to us many advices about the applicabilty of the learned concepts that could help anyone to get more confident while having to conceptualize the ML problems and to implement the adequate machine learning systems.  However, I would have appreciated that some of the scripts that were already implemented would have been part of the exercises to help us enlarging the technical skills gained using Octave/Matlab. Specifically, some of the plotting scripts or the script to implement the pre-processing of the e-mail text (spam classifier exercise) could have been opened to some stepwise implement to participants. Nevertheless, my general impression of the course is extremely positive.  ",5
544,"Hello, I just want to say that this course was extremely interesting. I am a phd student in physics and tried to find a way to learn machine learning by myself. Luckely, one of my colleagues recommended this course and so I started and enjoyed it very much. I think that I learned quite a lot and are now eager to apply this knowledge to my own projects and finally also help other people. For me this course was the perfect starting point and I am sure that I will remember it for a very long time. I also would like to thank you that you provided all this material for free. Although I paid for the certificate I know a lot of student who might not have the ability to pay money for special books or so. I hope that I can also recommend this course to a lot of future students and wish you all the best. Best regards and thanks for the beautiful course!  Sebastian",5
545,"I wanted to say how Iam grateful for this oppurtunity to take this 
outstanding course. Honestly, that was best class I've been through for 
all my life. Proffesor Andrew Ng has really wonderfull style of 
teaching, its a big honour for me being your student. I wish someday I 
will be able be your student in real life. I understood every aspect of 
this class, all explanations were clear and repeating. It made me clear 
up and feel all maths and technicalities. Programming exercises were 
great, I saw how algorithms are working  in my PC downrightby my  
commands. Andrew Ng is a machine learning developer, so his stories of 
live examples were awesome.",5
546,"I found this course has a good pace, I feel like I've learnt a lot but at the same time nothing was rushed and I never felt like I was struggling to understand. I think many of the examples used were well considered and give you confidence that you could actually create your own machine learning algorithm for your own application. My only criticism would be with some of the programming assignments, where I would sometimes spend more time trying to understand the existing code (so that mine would be using the right matrix indices for example) than actually doing the maths and learning about the intended subject. I don't know how you could get around this problem without requiring the student to write the whole program themselves though, which I certainly would not prefer! Maybe this is an inevitable consequence.",5
547,"i learnt something, but i can never able to use it. i have no idea, anyway, ML is just still having the real application for the command development field in the business now. for example like me, working in software development firm and medicare company before, none of them really applied the machine learning theory. although, they have certain value if applied, for example i saw many of them trying to convert their business to big data business, however they never use the big data correctly, assuming applied a machine learning in order to predict the potential customer response of a single product, it looks fun. anyway, fact is fact, currently the business is still a relatively low technical level business. everything is report, linear, and simple ( i will not say unfortunately, at least i have time to write this comment when i am actually working)",5
548,"I really enjoyed this course, Andrews bottom up style gives you enough detail to understand the key concepts in machine learning and lay the foundations for further training.  Andrew shields you from the hard maths but creates an understanding of the intuition that makes you feel you know the maths.  ",5
549,This course provides an excellent introduction into machine learning and is a great resource for anyone looking to get into AI/machine learning/peep learning. Most of the methods and concepts are useful even in today's deep learning era. I would especially like to point out prof. Ngs excellent advice on applying the taught algorithms and general best practices. ,5
550,I was wondering why we are being forced to use Matlab/Octave in a time when everyone that i know uses Python. I realized it's wisdom in the first week itself. ,5
551,"Andrew Ng presents the major machine learning algorithms, explaining them from the ground up. The level of detail in this courses was great from my point of view: it skips some of the calculus (e.g. doesn't show working for most derivates), but does explain the linear algebra involved. This is important because the parallel processing needed to implement machine learning efficiently relies on use of matrices and vectors - as done in the coding assignments in this course, which were a lot of fun to solve.",5
552,"This is a truly superb class.  Professor Andrew Ng's lectures are clear, well-organized, and exceptionally informative.  He's more than a brilliant researcher: he does a terrific job of presenting complex machine learning concepts in simple terms that a very easy for anyone to understand as well.  I would add that the programming assignments are also very useful because they focus on core concepts and really help to reinforce the lectures.  All around this is easily one of the best and most valuable courses I have ever taken, and I would be very quickly to recommend this course to any friend without reservation.  Whether you're actively working with machine learning systems as I am or hoping to get into the field or merely curious, Andrew Ng's machine learning class is a very valuable class that covers the essentials and covers them very thoroughly.",5
553,"This is a truly great course on a fascinating and important topic by one of the world's leading experts.  Andrew Ng chooses the most important topics in a field that is rapidly evolving.  He goes into depth on various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.  He discusses the mathematics of the algorithms, how to implement it in code and examples of real world applications.  ",5
554,"There are tons of ML classes on internet (even for free), but this one is the A)most comprehensive topics coverage, and B) easiest to understand. ",5
555,"I think this course is the best entry into the concepts of ML you can find. Andrew Ng is a wonderful, passionate teacher and explains most concepts in a way that is easy to grasp. I liked the emphasis on supervised learning and taking time to explain the very foundation with linear regression, logistic regression in great detail. When you look around the internet everyone is talking about cNN, Deep Learning, GANs, ... but the truth is - you first need to get your foundation right before moving on the more advanced topics. ML is actually a lot of mathematics, stochastic - so getting initial knowledge about these topics is important. Some things in the course where not that well explained, for example Back Propagation. In general I can recommend this course to anyone who wants to START with Machine Learning and needs some orientation on the subject.",5
556,"Overall, the course appears dated but is very interesting, very informative, very well taught, and very relevant. The course is a bit old now (2011?), which is apparent in the relatively low quality of the video and audio. But since it deals with the basics of machine learning, it is still 100% relevant to 2021, and the audio/video quality is good enough for purpose. There are some minor mistakes here and then that could be corrected, but it is understood that Prof Ng has moved to other ventures and so won't be recording the material again. Mentors are quick to answer and help students. Quizzes and programming exercises are of suitable difficulty. I did the entire course at 1.5x playback speed and could finish it in about a month, partly over holidays. Only disappointment is that there was nothing on decision trees (Random Forest, Boosted trees).",5
557,This course was amazing in many different ways:,5
558,"This is a fantastic course for beginners. The only pre-requisite you need are fundamentals of high school math (Matrices, Vectors & their operations) and some basic computer programming knowledge (any language is fine as long as you can understand variables, arrays, for-loops & functions). Prof. Andrew Ng's teaches basic & advanced concepts in a manner that is easy to follow. What helped me the most were the programming exercises at the end of each chapter to help understand the different algorithms and the parameters that define them, better. ",5
559,"This course is a great introduction to Machine Learning. It guides you through the most relevant machine learning algorithms and techniques and gives you insight into the mathematical essence of each algorithm, until the point that you will be able to program them (a basic version) yourself in the Matlab programming language.",5
560,"Great introduction to machine learning. The videos were very good at breaking down the different concepts and algorithms. It was very helpful to have summary notes available. The quizzes were useful to consolidate knowledge. The programming assignments were at an appropriate level of difficulty, for the most part, where they required some thought but were doable within a reasonable amount of time for a beginner.",5
561,"It is a great course in order to begin with Machine Learning. Covers every basic aspect of this field, even every some more advanced topics, the explanations are very good and the practical exercises are interesting. The course is well suited even if you do not have a good level of programming or Mathematics.",5
562,"This course has been highly delightful to learn through the concepts of machine learning. For someone like me having 17years programming experience, and with some hands on of neural networks from colelge days, and analytic tools for a few applications in R; it is a great refresher on the fundamentals and great breadth of practical technology elements that are most useful in machine learning applications. ",5
563,"This course is wonderful and charming. By taking this course, I got the basic knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Concretly,I knew what is supervised learning and unsupervised learning and I also learned how to operate that by myself through a fresh language called Octave,which I never used before. Besides,I also want to express my thanks to Prof.Andrew Ng for his kindness teaching and shareing his knowledge in this field. Not only his broad knowledge but also his skillful teaching method that  impressed me a lot. He could always taught us many difficult and obscure conception by taking some simple and clear examples,which can let us understand easily. ",5
564,"Dr. Andrew Ng has the unique ability to explain complex and articulated concepts with incredible ease and effectiveness. Throughout the entire course there's never been a moment where I felt lost because each topic was explained very well and even though several years have passed since this course was released, it remains maybe the best one to get both all the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning and getting the hands dirty by implementing the algorithms in a low-level fashion using the Octave language. It certainly is difficult but it helps you understand all the little things that otherwise would've been difficult to understand by only watching videos about theory.",5
565,"The course is an excellent introduction to the Machine Learning techniques. While the field is evolving by the day, having the experience to code the basic and powerful algorithms by hand provides a fair confidence and intuition of the inner workings of these cool-sounding techniques. The subtly introduced idea of Matrices as efficient computation model was very interesting having read it back last time in high school math without knowing what their real life application was. Immense gratitude is in order for Andrew Ng (and probably team) for having created the course that helps one focus on coding the actual algorithm rather than the data preparation and other data flow problems (which I understand is more than half the time spent for a practitioner). This is a must-do course for people thinking of starting to learn about this field. ",5
566,"This is the course for which I have joined Coursera initially. Professor is very elaborate in explaining anything. I am a student from core Mathematics and Statistics background. But I feel that the course is designed in such a away that any students without having a high school level knowledge of basic mathematics and programming can grasp the ideas discussed here. But I would recommend this course as an introductory course to those who are rather interested in the core mathematics behind Machine Learning. For me, It was a good course to get a overview of Machine Learning as I didn't have a proper course in ML earlier. The positive thing is, a positive interest have been built regarding ML as I was learning from Professor Andrew. I will definitely go further to learn deeper in mathematics of  ML and it's improvements down the years. ",5
567,"I enjoyed this course a lot. I found the lectures to be pitched at an appropriate level and were not boring or rudimentary. I would have liked there to be either links or optional lectures to the math and derivations for some of the algorithms that were glossed over in the lectures (such as backpropagation of neural nets) for those of us with the math background and interest, but I agree with the general approach of not bogging the class down with these full derivations.  I think Andrew Ng's explanations/intuitive justifications of the various algorithms were what made the lectures really special.  That intuitive understanding is much more valuable than going through a long derivation.  I thought the programming assignments were excellent and impressed that the computer grading worked flawlessly.  ( I used the MATLAB online option.)  ",5
568,"This course is definitely one of the best out there to take for a beginner in ML, especially since most of it is free. If you have prior knowledge of ML and how things work, this course is probably more of a refresher. However, if you are a beginner like myself, you will gain a significant amount of understanding of how various ML algorithms are implemented that you would not have otherwise. This course would have been AMAZING if it was taught using Python but it was still a great learning experience (although I can tell I'm not a fan of MATLAB). I am so happy I took this course and am confident to say I have come a long way from being a novice to being competent. A HUGE thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for creating this course. I hope to take more of his courses in the future!! He just makes the hardest concepts sound a lot more simple.",5
569,"This course has to be one of the most magnificent course that I have ever taken. I spent sometime on other online courses on machine learning but did not complete them because the tutors didn't connect with me, the way Andrew did and that has been one of the primary reasons why I love this course and as a result of which the subject Machine Learning as well. Behind every successful student there lies a passionate teacher guiding him towards success and Andrew has had that influence on me. Thanks a ton for making our lives more exciting and for encouraging us to keep dreaming big. This is the best course and I highly recommend it to everyone who have prior programming experience and have interest in Machine Learning. Cheers! Thanks to Coursera too for providing Financial Aid which helped me pursue this course in the first place!!",5
570,"Great fundamentals course. If you know your fair share of mathematics and optimization concepts you will definitely be more comfortable, but Andrew Ng makes great strides in providing conciseness for these complex topics and algorithms. I am an Industrial Engineer and so I have come in to the course with the mindset and understanding of these optimization topics, but was new to many of the applications within machine learning. I have taken a few other machine learning courses, and in retrospect I believe prospective students should start with this course. If you are not familiar with linear algebra, Andrew goes through a refresher, so even that is covered. Only difficulty in the program is the programming itself. I am a self taught programmer, so that didn't stall me, but that is the only thing I could see holding students back.",5
571,"The material might be a bit old, the video and audio quality not living up to today's standards, and Octave is a tool many won't consider as a starting point in machine learning. However, the material is presented in a way that it's easy to understand and motivating to continue working on the course. The way the graded programming exercises are implemented is just great; the system gives you a fast feedback and works flawlessly.",5
572,"Thank you Andrew Ng for this great course. I had a bit of research experience with regression analysis, neural networks and PCA, but this was my first ""real"" introduction to the fascinating world of machine learning algorithms, and I am greatly satisfied! I found the course to be really well structured.  it begins with ""simple"" linear regression models, and progressively builds up to more complex / elaborate systems. The subsequent lectures not only present new models, but also gradually uses the accumulated knowledge presented previously, in addition to pointing towards important aspects to consider when designing / tweaking a real-world model. Again, thank you very much. I can't wait to learn more about machine learning techniques, and to apply them to my own research work in biomedical engineering and human motor control.",5
573,"Great course with a lot of useful machine learning concepts. Good balance between theory and practice. Andrew Ng guides adequately each one of the lessons with good examples and fruitful suggestions either for the better comprehension or for the better application in a professional/practical concepts application. Some other fine machine learning algorithms could be presented here (decision trees, bayesian networks, hidden markov chains, genetics algorithms, etc), nevertheless it is understandable that the course has a specific scope either in a group of topics either in time, so no regrets about not finding more machine learning subjects here, it represents my new learning backlog for the future. Very satisfied with the material, the course structure, the exercises and the teacher. I will recommend it to my engineer friends.",5
574,"Excellent course. Very good introduction to numerous facets of ML. I supervise and generally work with a group of data scientists, data engineers, and ML engineers for one of the biggest companies in the world, but my background is more tailored to translating customer requirements, owning the vision for product development, filling in gaps, removing blockers, etc. - this was a huge leap forward for me in terms of speaking the language. Huge thank you to Professor Ng. Only complaint is the lack of emphasis on the actual iterator variables used in highly involved summation algorithms. At point, it was even stated that the iterators (i, j, k, etc.) and the total counts (n, m, etc.) were not that important. THEY ARE, pay super close attention to which one is which is Professor Ng walks you through it, and it will help a lot.",5
575,"Amazing course completely worth every second spent on it. I was enrolled in a similar subject in my University and I decided to unsubscribe from it and do some other stuff to get the credits as it involved so much time due to its really long practices (mainly due to documentation, dealing with Python peculiarities and collaborating with really junior or low performing students) that it was impossible for me to get the time to properly work on it, as I'm also working and doing some other subjects.",5
576,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic teacher. He preempts questions, and he doesn't shy away from important nuances just because they are difficult to teach. His course provides thorough knowledge of machine learning on a theoretical and conceptual basis. The course does not provide very thorough knowledge of actual implementation, mostly because the heavy lifting of the coding has already been done in the assignments. This is a course on Machine Learning, not on Python or Octave, so I'm glad he devoted the lecture time to the main topic. That said, the course will go much faster for those with some computer science knowledge and coding experience. If you're planning to take this class, stick with it through the end. The coolest applications are there, and the tough parts in the middle are necessary for them to be fully appreciated.",5
577,"I think this course is really amazing. Dr. Andrew has really designed this course for a really broad audience. As someone working with numerical methods and algorithms on a daily basis, I found his use of simpler terminology very effective to help those without a mathematical background understand easily. Moreover, the examples he used to explain the algorithms were usually pretty relatable in the current world scenario. ",5
578,"Machine Learning by Andrew NG was luckily my first ever online course ever. Through this course,  I learned various machine learning algorithms and got a chance to get hands-on experience on them as well. Andrew very greatly and simply explains some complex machine learning algorithms in this course and covers almost all the required points in the lectures itself. It is a must course to take if you want to develop an interest in this field or want to explore the same.",5
579,General: The course can be done by very beginners. If you are familiar with statistics and calculus you might have a bit more fun. ,5
580,"Excellent course! Andrew knows how to teach a subject that is not very trivial.
",5
581,"Excellent! I'm amazed at how much I learned. If there's is an Academy award for online courses, this would win the ""best picture"" award (and I wish there is to help highlight well-developed courses). Lectures, tutorials, resources were great, clear and most importantly, effective in communicating concepts, algorithms and developing the necessary programming skills (and I'm saying this after trying many others and giving up mid way). I have no doubt that this course will continue to stay relevant and evolve as this field as well as online delivery format progresses. I'm very very thankful for having access to such wonderful training material, made possible by founders of coursera, which I understand to include Prof Andrew Ng. I'm also very inspired by how coursera democratizes access to courses from top universities. ",5
582,"I am deeply grateful to Professor Ng and all collaborators and contributors who have invested their resources into making this course a huge success. It has been very meaningful to me as a lover of learning new things and acquiring knowledge. I took the course to get my foot in the door of ML/AI. I one day hope to be an academic researcher in either this or another related field. I cannot thank the community and course faculty enough. The concepts presented are explained very clearly, pitched at an appropriate level, and the course is always engaging and thought-provoking. Thanks again.",5
583,"The practice with applications in the programming assignments in this course was by far the most helpful aspect. If anything, I would have liked to have more programming assignments, and for some of them to be more challenging in terms of having the student build tools from the ground up (though I know most are available in Octave and Mathematica libraries). I also would have liked more mathematical derivations/proofs at times, but I recognize that those were arguably outside the scope of the course. Andrew did a great job explaining concepts clearly and the forum moderators apparently put in exhaustive effort to answer students questions and creative a very useful reference for other users. Thanks for putting in the time to create this great resource, especially writing out all the programming assignment content!",5
584,"Creo es el mejor curso con el que se puede comenzar en esta ciencia, 100% recomendado, no solo aprendes los conceptos, también los aplicas en octave/matlab, lo cual te da una idea de como comenzar a desarrollar en otros lenguajes, cuesta un poco adaptarse al ritmo del curso comparado con otros cursos en linea, pero vale la pena el esfuerzo, a las personas interesadas en el curso les recomiendo adelanten lo que puedan para que lleven bien el tiempo especialmente en la semana 9, la cual considero para mi fue la semana que mas tiempo me consumió, sin embargo el tema es bastante  interesante para los que nos gusta tener una pequeña visión de como pueden funcionar algunas de las tecnologías de los gigantes en la red, de igual forma les recomiendo lleven sus propias anotaciones en una cuaderno de repaso siempre es útil.",5
585,"Where to start? This course is one of the best I have ever taken in my life: 
",5
586,,5
587,A very good introduction to the subject that moves at a good pace but doesn't make such big jumps that it is difficult to follow.  Andrew Ng presents the subject clearly and gives some good insights.,5
588,"I've learned a lot in this course and I hope that I'll be able to apply this in my career. For those of you contemplating on taking this class, don't be worried about not knowing linear algebra or some other concepts that Andrew may mention, what you should know is that there are many resources out there (even the forums have some good material) that will help you move forward. Finally, I have to say, that after watching Andrew's last thank you video (I may or  may not have shed a little year), I'm a bit bummed out because my journey in this class is over. However, rest assured that my learning journey in ML is not  over and I hope to learn more in the coming years. All in all, I definitely recommend you do this course if you want to learn about ML and want to apply it to some real world problems. Thanks Andrew! ",5
589,"I enjoyed this course, its balanced, easy enough for a general software programmer to start off into this math world. One thing I would wish for is a lesson exclusively talking about all the available options for any production needs, and talking about the different jargon that is used out there in the ML world and how we can relate it back to the jargon used in this course. ",5
590,"First of all, I am deeply indebted to and congratulate Prof. Andrew Ng and Coursera for providing such a valuable course for free of cost. The option of buying the course is also highly appreciated.",5
591,"I highly recommend this course as a starting point for every student found of data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Professor Ng is one of the best instructor you could find in a MOOC. He knows how to walk us through complex ideas in a simple manner and, through his own passion, arouses our interest for this enjoyable subject. ",5
592,"I learned a lot of concepts in an organized and structured manner in this course that I probably would have spent months trying to figure out on my own. Prof. Ng is one of the best teachers I have had, in spite of the fact that this was an online course. Thank you so much for providing these resources for the world to learn from. This is nothing short of a miracle. Suggestions for the course would be - updating lecture notes for the latter half of the course and maybe more mathematical rigor. If it is not possible to add more rigorous math to this course, links to material that cover the topics in more depth would be nice. Also, can we have a Machine Learning 2 course that would cover some of these topics in more detail plus some new topics? I'd take that course in a heart beat, as I am sure many others would. ",5
593,"This was my first class in machine learning and in this class I have learnt a lot. Basically before this class I was wondering that there must be some magic behind the fact that machines can learn to do things and then can improve themselves too and after taking this course I now know that all that magic was just mathematics and some basic steps. This course is great and I highly recommend it to those who know nothing about machine learning. This should be your first course in my opinion. Also, do the assignments with full concentration and try to read the code of each and every function to get an in depth understanding of the algorithm. Andrew is really an amazing instructor. This course will make you capable of applying the machine learning concepts to build some cool systems of your own. Highly recommended!",5
594,"Loved this course! It was nice to get a real world comparison of the runtime of perfect mathematical solutions to problems like optimization vs. algorithmic solutions. In my experience, math classes tend to favor solving for variables algebraically, when the calculation of such a solution in many cases apparently takes much longer than the very accurate approximation obtained by gradient descent, for example! Also, I must admit I got a rush from implementing my first neural network, even though it was a lot simpler than I assumed it would be. I thought it was so cool to have built an autonomous program that can read numbers from a pixel array! Finally, I've always found the topic of data compression to be fascinating, so having algorithms and analysis tools for compression is pretty helpful. Thanks, Dr. Ng! :D",5
595,"Very well explained, and the subject is extremely interesting and contemporary. Made for people with almost no experience. But, it's also great for people who already have more in depth statistical/computational knowledge, as you can simply skip videos whose contents you already know. The programming assignments are also really good at testing your knowledge, and they are very satisfying to complete. They don't require many lines of code, but you really have to understand what you're supposed to do when you write the few lines code that are actually required. I'd like it to be longer and perhaps go a little deeper, but I guess that can be done through other courses (Like Dr. Ng's recently released Deep Learning Course), so this course is complete, as far as it's main purpose is concerned. Pretty much perfect. ",5
596,"I really like this course, specially the way Prof. Andrew Ng explains mathematical intuitions behind algorithms and concepts. I have done many courses in maths including linear algebra, statistical analysis ,signal processing etc, but never seen any professor explaining mathematical aspect behind algorithms, concepts in simpler way. I really like to thank Prof. Andrew for teaching this course so that people like me understands some of the concepts which were confusing to understand in past. After finishing this course, I feel confident in not only in applying algorithm in application but also to improve algorithm performance. Once again, I really like to thank people who made this course possible. ",5
597,"Machine Learning by prof. Andrew Ng is excellent! In my opinion, it is among the very best courses on Coursera. It is thorough, well taught, and provides extensive learning materials, and lecture notes. Each lesson comes with graded programming assignments, and has detailed instructions on how to apply the knowledge easily.",5
598,"I listened about this course from one of my friends during my graduation days and Since then I always wanted to complete it, I tried once earlier and couldn't complete the deadlines, but this time I completed well before the course end date, I am glad to overcome my mistakes. This course has formed my basis of ML and its concepts along with practical implementations has helped me in my job. Quizzes require good insight about the algorithms and thus encourages to follow course material carefully, following course material is enough to complete quizzes and practical assignments. I would like to thank course Instructor and all mentors for all resources and help provided through the course. Special thanks to Coursera for making this course as an open course to help all students learn ML and its applications.",5
599,It was an honor to complete this course by Andrew Ng. The scope of the course is well defined and the professor respects it by not spending more time than needed on some maths concepts such as calculus. Being someone who is familiar with calculus I was pleased to see that the course focuses on machine learning and does not waste valuable time teaching calculus. That is not to say that there is no maths in the course because there is but the level is fairly accessible even if you don't know what calculus is. I would have appreciated a little bit more hands-on exercices between assignments  but that is a subjective opinion. The course has a lot of theory but every week you get an assignment to validate the theory. I would recommend this course to anybody who wishes to get started with machine learning.,5
600,"Excellent overview of Machine Learning. The goal of this course is to explain the main ML algorithms from a practical, intuitive perspective. This is accomplished using real-world examples, and the key ideas and techniques are reinforced by Matlab/Octave exercises.  [No prior Matlab/Octave experience is assumed, and in fact, this course allows one to pick up the basics easily, if needed.]  The key mathematical results that underlie the algorithms are presented, but there are no rigorous derivations or proofs.  Some differential calculus and linear algebra background would be helpful, but it really isn't necessary to do well in the course, and to apply the various algorithms successfully.  Finally, I found the notation consistent and clear throughout the course, and this helped to tie things together.",5
601,"The best course I've taken on Coursera so far. This was the first ever course offered on Coursera, by the founder himself, Andrew Ng. He's a great instructor, covering topics right from the ground to the sky. I'd say the implementation is in OCTAVE instead of popular languages like R/Python, which could have improved upon a lot for learners. But since Andrew has focussed this course upon beginners, I think OCTAVE is apt. ",5
602,Great introduction to Machine Learning.,5
603,"Just Excellent, everything about this course is just fantastic, beginning with Prof.Andrew, passing with his passion for the subject and his motivation to really make you understand everyword he says, he is keen on delivering all this expertise and this alone is a fine quality, the course is well organized and the quizzes and programing assignements are to the point and are a very good exercise, I just felt the course needed 2 small videos one addresssing the differences between linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs and Neural Networks and another video exciting people  by a small example of machine learning on self-driving cars (very small programming assignments to help excite people and give them an-overall idea)",5
604,"This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. It was so great and very helpful of implementation.",5
605,"Immensely helped me to start off with Machine Learning. Every concept is deliberated beautifully by the instructor. He has great expertise in the field and understands especially on how to teach or guide the novices and think from their perspective. In this regard he delivers what is concretely required. This course bridges the gap between applicability of the algorithms and mathematics behind it without deeply diving into the latter. If someone isn't well versed with Linear Algebra,Calculus and Statistics they might find themselves impatient for superficial explanation in this regard. This course would have been ideal if it's worked out with the current language in demand and bit more practical. Overall, In my opinion I would definitely recommend this course for all the beginners.",5
606,"Andrew Ng's teaching methods go a long way in imprinting the concepts very clearly in our minds and makes us understand each and every concept perfectly before moving on to the next. Perhaps he is THE best instructor out there in the field of machine learning. The exercises have been designed in an absolutely error-free way that helps us to quickly learn from them without any hassle. That, combined with the small small instances where Andrew talks about his practical experiences makes us more confident in our course progress. ",5
607,"Very well taught class by Prof. Andrew Ng, he explains everything in a really cool way by showing the benefits and applications of a concept first before diving deep into the formulas. I read some reviews mentioning the high focus on math but I experienced it differently. Coming from a Computer Science background it was easy to follow the mathematical part even if you're not very strong in math like myself. You just need a little linear algebra to follow and understand everything, as the hard proofs aren't presented. One last thing, maybe this course should be in python now, however, Matlab was very easy to start and it gives you more of the theoretical understanding compared with python. This is due to the intuitive mathematical syntax of Matlab which is very similar to the mathematical formulas.",5
608,"I am a student in engineering and i had a lot of notion of Machine Learning already. I learned in class and myself so i already knew the majority of the concepts. But i have to say, i am glad to have taken this class because i realised that some algorithms i thought i knew were way better explained and that finally, i didn't know them well. Also, after having done several Machine Learning projects for my school, i ended up using libraries without knowing exactly what the algorithm did. Now I know.",5
609,"Brilliant introduction to machine learning. Shows the student that there is *so* much more to the field than just the fancy, hot topic things like neural networks and self driving cars. There really is a simpler and fundamental grounding to these things and it turns out that we can achieve amazing results with just a bit of clever matrix algebra and calculus.",5
610,"What's great about this course is that it not only teaches about the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning, but it also gives you a chance to get your hands dirty and apply what you learn on real life applications. The course provides programming exercises which are a great way to demonstrate some of the cool stuff you could build with the knowledge that you gain throughout the course. What's more, the way the material is provided makes it possible for inexperienced people who have no background in Machine Learning or Mathematics to get a pretty good understanding of the way the algorithms work without delving too deeply into their most intimate details. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this course, and I would definitely recommend it to those who are just starting out with Machine Learning. ",5
611,"What I loved about this course is that Andrew jumps right into the details without a lot of fluff that other lecturers use to fill the time.  The mini-quizzes that pop up during the lecture videos help to solidify the material being learned.  The graded quizzes are just challenging enough to make sure you did actually comprehend the lectures.  The programming assignments were fun, challenging, although I did notice that there was quite a bit of hand-holding when it came to setting up the algorithms and executing them.  A lot of the heavy lifting was already done, but it was just enough to get the point across by allowing the student to think about how to implement the main algorithm being studied.  Overall, I do recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started with machine learning!",5
612,"Really good course.... Enjoyed learning this although Machine learning being a alien topic to me. Understood every chapter, lessons and all the topic. It helped me to realise that machine learning is something in which I can do my career. As it is just the start of my career this realisation was important for me.....Only one thing that I didn't understood from the course is that how to make our own features for any image input or so, but I am sure that it has cleared my other topics so much that I can get the information from other sources as well and will be able to understand it quickly from the point of view that any one should have for a particular problem, which I learned from this course.... Thankyou for the course and for making such knowledge available to us just at the click of a mouse ",5
613,I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed this course! I'm so glad I took this up in my summer vacations and this course helped my curiosity. I wish to learn more and more and I might as well take up the Deep Learning course next! Thank you so much to Andrew Ng for being such a great teacher and explaining concepts well to make sure students get the intuition behind how things work. It's my passion to learn something new and through this course I've learned something new and something I am very much interested in. I am glad to be able to feel that I have mastery over some knowledge in Machine Learning! I'd suggest this course to anyone interested in Computer Science and AI etc. It was worth my time and surely will be if anyone else takes this course up. Thank you once again Andrew Ng and Coursera!,5
614,A very well framed course. A great pool of knowledge imparted by Andrew Sir. ,5
615,"I thought Andrew's explanations of the course material were outstanding. I really felt like it was just the right amount of time devoted to each topic and that I had developed a solid intuition after watching each video and participating in the embedded understanding check. In fact, I thought these checks were very well thought out and forced me to apply some deep reasoning into the material. The one thing I would have liked was even more problems to work through to reinforce my understanding. Maybe an optional ""additional problems"" for each section. Also, I would have enjoyed working on a programming assignment for the large scale machine learning module. That said, I understand that additional work may not be in line with the scope/goal of this course, so overall I thought it was excellent.",5
616,"To everyone reading this, I hope you had enjoyed this course as much as I did. It's a basic yet sufficient introduction on the various Machine Learning concepts that can definitely be improved upon. Even though some of the information from the lectures differ from how they are actually implemented in the Programming Assignments, the important aspect -- conveying the ideas in clear format was still achieved.",5
617,"The only valuable constructive criticism I have is that for the first few ""weeks"" (I completed the class in about 20 days), I didn't know about the programming exercise tutorials, and while I really struggled to complete them because of this, I also really got a solid understanding of what was going on, and how valuable dimensional analysis is for vectorized solutions. Once I found the tutorials, the programming assignments became trivially easy, as Tom and the other's writings, while intentionally not explicitly copy-pastable, give very clear guidance on how to solve the problems. As a result, I am almost positive I'm going to go back and re-implement back-prop from scratch because I don't feel I have a solid grasp on it. Great course overall, can't wait to get more involved in this field. ",5
618,"This class is a thorough and enjoyable introduction to Machine Learning. While I have had prior experience with statistics, linear algebra, and Matlab, this course helped me completely reimagine how one could creatively explore the marriage between these various mathematical concepts that I learned about individually in school. As a co-founder of Coursera, Andrew Ng puts forth a brilliant instruction package which includes: introductions to Matlab, linear algebra, and statistics; well-paced lectures on machine learning concepts and workflow considerations; and insightfully designed coding projects that enable students to practice machine learning rather than syntactical debugging. Whether you are a beginner or are experienced in Machine Learning, I highly recommend giving this course a go.",5
619,,5
620,"Excellent course, very well explained with a lot of examples and intuitions. The practical exercises are very well structured to make you think of what you were taught in the class. The teacher explains every part very well with a lot of examples and real case scenarios. If you want to start learning artificial intelligence this is the place to be. There are many algorithms you are taught and many good practices that should be applied to this algorithms to make them effective and performant. Something nice to have, would be the written courses or some paperback with the main ideas, but the videos are downloadable which fills this gap pretty good. Overall this is a nice course and you definitely should attend it if you're new to machine learning or want to better consolidate your knowledge.",5
621,"If there is any course that boosts the confidence of beginners in ML, it is THIS. Challenging topics were taught in a very lucid and organized manner. Many thanks to Prof Andrew Ng and team behind it. Questions were carefully designed in programming assignments so as to guide the student at every aspect of learning. Hints have surely helped me to think in right direction. Cracking the problems all by himself/herself is what boosts the confidence and clarification of queries is important aspect of this. A big thanks to mentors. Replies were quick and to the point. Anyone without any prior knowledge of programming and /or mathematics can easily take the course and complete it with such a well organize platform. What all students need is continuity. Thanks coursera, Prof Andrew Ng and team.",5
622,"This course is the first properly organised and designed study material for me to learn and transition into Data Science profession. The course is very very well designed and covers a range of topics. The quizzes and programming assignments have been tough to pass for some of the modules and that gives the course a feel of complete learning experience at par with classroom learning experience. The examples in lectures and programming assignments are from real world applications and provides a great feeling to know how some of the things I use actually work behind the scenes, like recommender systems for movies/products, image to text conversion systems, image compresionm market segmentation etc. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn/implement machine learning.",5
623,"Excellent course and great content. The course videos were well presented and were able to explain the subject matter well. The course covered most of the key topics in ML. Prof Andrew has done a fantastic job in creating content, content delivery and setting up the programming exercises. The course Mentors were also very helpful and always available.",5
624,,5
625,"At the beginning, I thought it would be hard for a starter in ML; however, during the process, I found the course setting is easy to follow, especially the quiz, which help me master the key point of each class. And the programming exercises give me the intuition in applying each individual ML skills. I think the course settings are convenient and practical. So after finishing the course, I have excuse to recommend other ML beginners to join the course, which will help to build a skeleton of the knowledge about the concept, algorithm, and skills in ML. AND thank Andrew and Coursera for giving such an practical guidance.",5
626,The subject of the course concerns how to estimate parameters to make predictions about data and to classify data.,5
627,Andrew Ng's teaching methods are simple and effective. I appreciate his focus on ensuring students understand the underlying ML algorithms and techniques and merely using a tool such as Octave or MATLAB for implementation purposes.,5
628,Great course. ,5
629,Professor Ng does a great job of making complex concepts simple and reassures the student by sharing what to focus on and what is not important. I also loved the programing exercises that made sure that I understood the material well to get it right. This whole course changed the way I approach problem solving and showed me ways that I learned that were not conducive and how to improve my future learning (e.g. it is easy to write code but 90% of the effort is in debugging; really reading through all the material and understanding what the exercise is asking + reading through FAQ/programming resources was a better strategy than trying to start coding as soon as possible with limited understanding). Thank you Professor Ng and teaching mentors! You've made a huge difference in my life!,5
630,"Excellent course from one of the masters in the field, Andrew Ng. ",5
631,"The best MOOC on Machine Learning I know of. Covers many statistics-based / numerical algorithms, plus Neural Networks and SVMs. I found this course very useful because:",5
632,"I'm impressed at how clearly the material was communicated and how the quizzes and programming assignments were difficult/complex enough to be challenging and educational but not overwhelming. I also appreciate how clear and well-commented the provided framework code was. This made it easy to understand how the code we needed to write was being used and helped cement my understanding of how the algorithms work. My only complain (very minor) is that it seemed that some formulas and examples presented in the slides were transposed differently from the example data provided in the programming assignments. This required me to really understand what the matrix multiplications were doing (which was good) but was also frustrating at times. In any case, thanks for an overall-great course!",5
633,"Thanks you so much for putting together this class. I am a young professional in data science area and finally finished this class after more than 3 months. The topics are practical especially the last few weeks about designing pipeline and where to spend your time. At the very beginning, I found it's challenging and I have to watch the videos for a few times, take notes afterwards and refer to the formu to finish code assignment. But after completing week 5, everything works smoothly. Another very good thing about this course is Andrew also give review of relevant knowledge like linear algebra so I don't need to spend time searching for other resources. This is is a great class and I am going to apply what I have learnt to work. I am happy I finished this class on my birthday ; ) ",5
634,"This was my first coursera class, and I came out feeling confident in my use of the methods that Prof. Ng taught. The programming exercises do a very good job of guiding students through the implementational details of each learning method and usually provide examples to illustrate the strengths, weaknesses, and options within each. I'm a graduate student in a protein structure/rational drug design lab, and the topics from this class have already weaved their way into my projects. These methods are applicable to almost any quantitative form of data  - I strongly recommend this course for other young researchers, either to prepare to implement the methods themselves, or to just start thinking about how to format the conventions of their sceintific domain in a machine-learnable way!",5
635,"Andrew Ng did a fantastic job of giving an overview of many different Machine learning algorithms. Professor Ng gave practical checks to perform along the way, questions to ask regarding what to try next, and related all of it to real world examples he has seen. This course is definitely one that many people can accomplish without having an extensive background in mathematics, though the notation can get a bit tricky near the middle. I was a bit disappointed on a few occasions that Professor Ng didn't go into more depth on ""the how"" of the algorithm and found that a few items were glossed over. Overall, I found this course to be beneficial (especially with the aided programming assignments)  and it has given me motivation to continue to learn about machine learning in the future.",5
636,Great Lectures (presentation)! Great course organisation. ,5
637,"Thank you so much to everyone who put their hand to this beautiful course, especially prof. Andrew Ng whose voice is now associated for me with machine learning like maybe forever, and all the mentors who patiently helped all us newbies on the forum. Starting from Week 2 I could not resist the urge to write down everything Andrew says and writes so now I have a perfect clear notes about main topics of machine learning, using which I believe I can explain the main concepts to almost any person. The course is in fact so good, even being somewhere in the middle of it, I was able to talk and keep up the conversation with professionals from the industry without feeling any lack of theoretical knowledge.",5
638,"It is a well structured wonderful course for people who are new to concepts of Machine Learning.
",5
639,"An excellent overview of some of the most popular machine learning algorithms in use today. I particularly enjoyed the mathematical treatment of the subject matter, rather than simply plug-and-play algorithms, as are available in many software packages and libraries today. Additionally, the use of Octave / Matlab is a welcome change from many courses on data science / machine learning, most of which use Python and/or R. The use of Octave allows for the more mathematically mature discussion / implementation of each algorithm. I found it very rewarding to understand WHY these algorithms behave as they do, and what is actually going on ""under the hood."" Thanks to Andrew Ng and all of the TAs who worked so hard to make this course possible and maintain it for learners of the future.",5
640,The course has been a great overview about machine learning problems and algorithms. It also covers further details like advantages/disadvantages of certain techniques or ways to handle performance analysis and optimisations. Most explanations can be understood easily. Both videos (with visualisations) and texts are given to present the content (in the end there are less summaries).,5
641,"Awesome course! Some people might say it is a little outdated, but in reality, I've found it covers more material than the more updated version undersigned by Prof. Ng (DeepLearning.ai). Both courses complement each other and fill the gaps of each other. ",5
642,"It has been a real
pleasure to take this class and learn, without complicated math proofs, the
basics of machine learning algorithms and techniques. This material will help
me out to apply it at work. The quizzes and specially the programming
exercises have been of great help. The “Test cases resources” have been
extremely useful to check my implementations and debug my code. The week lecture
notes are very useful because it has all the lecture notes without the need to
go through all the video presentations. The course contains so much information
that I had gone over the material twice and still think I need more time to
really get a grasp of all the material. Thank you very much for making this
material available to all the people interested in learning about this
material. ",5
643,i basically don't write reviews in my life. But i am willing to write very positive review for this course. because it is so special and it brings me through the door of machine learning world.  ,5
644,"Professor Ng is not only one of the premier authorities in the field of machine learning. It turns out he is also one of the best educators I've ever experienced. I truly admire the easy with which he can explain complicated concepts. He chose the right pace to move through the material, and liked his enthusiasm which reverberated through each movie. I want to congratulate Professor Ng to this highly successful class. I've enjoyed every minute of this. I was new to machine learning, and I'm glad that Prof. Ng was the first who introduced me to to. He has given me a base knowledge to which I feel I can always come back when things get more complicated. ",5
645,"It was a great privilege to take part in this course. I had little to no knowledge in Machine Learning before taking this course. But I hope I have a sound understanding in this field. I have to thank all the mentors who  had  supported with solving the content related problems I had. Having questions in the video lectures  was a good idea as it keeps our attention to the videos. The Review questions also tested my skills and understanding very well. Programming assignments were time consuming a bit , but worth a lot. Flexibility with submission deadlines also helped me as I was busy during some weeks. Also this course helped me to solve an industry level  problem to a certain extent.Lectures  would be more understandable for anyone with little knowledge in mathematics too.",5
646,"This course was simply amazing. I got to know what happens under the hood in different machine learning algorithms. Prof. Ng was wonderful as the instructor for this course, and he presented these complex ML concepts in such simple ways. Also the mentors were great and I got response from them regarding my various doubts in the discussion forums. Lastly I would like to talk about the assignments. The quizes tested your theoretical concepts while the programming assignments were there to test how well you can convert your understanding to code. The problems like digit recognition, email classification, image compression to name a few gave us a lot of inside into the problems of ML in real life. In one word this course was exceptional and had a wonderful learning experience.",5
647,"This courses has introduced many interesting machine learning subjects, with a... ahem... learning curve that is just right for me. There are a lot of aha moments when you see the powerful effect of these algorithms on learning pictures, building a recommender system, creating clusters, etc. . The programing assignment is the most time consuming but it's not really difficult because students are only asked to fill in certain parts of certain functions. It does help to have a good foundation of linear algebra, but Prof Ng has simplified the maths to a great extent and provided tons of examples to make the algorithm as intuitive as possible. Great course! (The fact that I have finished it without missing a week is a testament of how interesting this class is at least to me.)",5
648,"The true value of this course lies in the excellent programming assignments. From identifying hand-written digits in postal codes to providing plausible movie recommendations for users of a streaming service, you can be sure that the problems are non-trivial, applicable, and elucidating. ",5
649,"I believe this is the most enjoyable nine weeks course that I ever had. Prof. Andrew has his way explaining a complex mathematical concept in an easy and non-intimidating way. I used to be afraid & dislike when it comes to statistics, machine learning related field. After following this course, I've gained a bit more courage to learn more complex and exciting field. The Quiz and programming works are challenging but enjoyable to do. It gives me more understanding about the topic while having fun applying the concept to real problems in my field of work.",5
650,"Quite and interesting course, and it has been very insightful.",5
651,"I specifically enjoyed the lab assignments in this course -- they were really good and felt overall well-designed. The course content was rather broad, although I would have enjoyed a section about rule based classification algorithms such as decision trees.",5
652,"I completely enjoyed this course and learnt a lot. I am a product manager working in IoT. I understand technology, but don't consider myself to be an expert programmer. I have not been doing serious programming in a long time, so I started this course assuming I will not be able to complete all the programming assignments. My goal was to get the basics of machine learning and system design to  ensure I can apply machine learning features to improve my products. I admit that I did struggle with some of the programming assignments, but I managed to complete all of assignments by leveraging the lecture notes, forums and videos.  ",5
653,"Great course for beginners in Machine Learning. Basics of Linear Algebra Probability Theory and Statistics are helpful throughout this course. Though prof. Ng did all best to help students without basic knowledge in those fields to pass the course, i.e. added an optional module about Linear Algebra and added special 'Intuition' videos that helps to get and intuitive understanding of the course material. But still there are some drawbacks: The first one is Matlab/Octave. Today Machine Learning is mostly done in Python. The course pushes student to use Matlab/Octave for that. Second possible drawback is that the course was created back in 2011 and wasn't updated since, so some best practices might have changed. But I'm not an expert in machine learning to evaluate that.",5
654,"Initially I was skeptical if I would be able to focus and complete the course. Though I had a slow start and off-and-on but after week 2, I got addicted to this class and I was surprised that I could focus with dedication and complete it. This was possible because the course was well structured, smooth transition of topics and continuity, well explained with good practical examples, well balanced with machine learning concepts, and mathematics. The quiz's really made us understand better as I had to redo some quiz's. The programming examples increased my confidence. ",5
655,If you are on the fence as to whether or not to take the class... take it!,5
656,"This was one of the best academic experiences I have ever had. This wasn't just a course about ML, but also a course to an educator about how to teach. I wish my university (USP) in Brazil could learn and apply some of the features of this course in their own course. Everything was explained in a very simple, complete, and didactic way, making associations with other disciplines such as calculus, linear algebra, statistic. This course teaches as how to properly understand ML, and not just to apply it, lie other courses. Besides that, Andrew also teaches how to properly create ML projects, making us not just students, but capable of implementing it ourselves in an efficient way. I don't know what else to say about how much I liked this course. Congratulations Andrew!",5
657,"Great course to get into machine learning. The explanations are clear, the pace is not high and the programming exercises are well constructed and helpful. The lecturer in some cases makes reference to somewhat more advanced concepts that may not be central in these course but that can be useful for some of the audience. Perhaps I'd like that the lecturer make the audience aware of the connections of machine learning with other disciplines and on the fact that machine learning borrows many concepts and methods from other areas (e.g., statistics and optimization). All in all, it is a course that I will recommend to anyone that wants to get introduced to machine learning and, in general, to know a number of techniques to actually address and solve real-life problems.",5
658,"I am a physician with a degree in CS, passionate about informatics applications in healthcare. I have finished this course and - WOW - what an eye opener, mind blowing educational experience it was.Andrew Ng gently takes us from the buzzwords to a clear methodology and the current ML tools kit used by ML practitioners. As the last time I've played with matrices, vectors, linear algebra and calculus - was many years ago in high school, I was a bit anxious about the math level required. Andrew has carefully calibrated the amount of math pain involved and for this I'd like to thank him again and again, as it allows individuals with little math or programming skills to understand and internalize the most important principles of state-of-the-art ML.Highly recommended !",5
659,"I am an experienced embedded software engineer with 18+ years of experience. I hold Masters degree in Applied Electronics Engineering. Currently I am on a long break from work. To enhance my knowledge with the latest technological developments in order to explore newer career opportunities, I had enrolled this Machine Learning Course.",5
660,"Excellent course. Challenging multiple choice quizzes (with many ""select all that apply"" questions that are hard to guess). The Matlab/Octave exercises are satisfying because most the solution to each exercise is provided, leaving the student to fill in only the most important lines of each algorithm. This course would not suit anyone looking to do machine learning using an entirely black box approach, with the algorithms entirely hidden. That said, this course would perfectly complement a course like that, because it gives the student the deeper understanding that comes from building the algorithms from scratch, but with plenty of practical tips on when & how to apply them. Huge thanks to Andrew for sharing his knowledge & materials with the e-learning community.",5
661,"The course introduces basic machine learning concepts and different kinds of techniques used in the field. It also goes over the tricks & trades associated with these techniques.  The way, Prof. Andrew Ng explained things with the help of examples, is indeed lucid. Quizzes and assignments are also well designed to test and improve our learning at the same time.  The answers from the instructors were quite prompt.   Just one suggestion - if there is a way to know or clarify some of the answers to the quiz questions at the end of the course that would help students.  Overall, I have enjoyed the course thoroughly and would highly recommend it to all people interested in Machine learning.  Heartiest thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng. and all other instructors in the course.",5
662,I think this class is really amazing! It doesn't require a lot of math background (but do require some programming background) to understand and apply the algorithms to real-life problems. The class gives a big picture of machine learning and is just right for beginners. ,5
663,"Today, August 4, 2018, I completed my very first online course - Machine Learning.  I have a number of reasons for taking this course but the top 3 are:",5
664,"Good overview of concepts/methods and applications, presented in a very understandable way, and the course was very enjoyable overall.",5
665,"Congratulation to Coursera for the excellent course! It teaches advanced Machine Learning concepts in a very practical manner, giving the student the tools to very promptly apply it in daily development activities, and yet in such a manner so as to also satisfy students searching for approaches well grounded in theory. Those are words from someone who had already studied Machine Learning with a textbook approach and was searching for additional resources.

666,"This course has absolutely made me a confident ML practitioner. I went from knowing very little about a few ML algorithms to being able to confidently implement many of them, and easily learn to implement others from outside resources. Beyond having mastered the algorithms themselves, I now feel equipped to effectively diagnose and debug problems in my own ML projects.",5
667,"This is a fantastic course. In my view if anyone wants to have a solid grip on ML this course is a must. Mr Andrew Ng is extremely knowledgeable on this subject. He explained each of the topics in a very detailed level. It is evident how much of thought process and effort have gone into it to design such a course. MATLAB exercises are also designed extremely carefully with great level of detail. If I am asked to suggest for any additional input in the course material, I would have probably requested for a little more explanation on how to arrive at covariance matrix and eigenvectors formula in Principal Component Analysis chapter. Overall, it is quite enriching experience to complete the course. Again I must thank Mr. Andrew Ng and Coursera for this course. ",5
668,"Dear Andrew and team,",5
669,"Professor Ng moved at a steady pace, and delivered an extraordinary amount of content in a short period of time, through both lectures and programming exercises. My knowledge of machine learning and algorithms tied to real world examples has grown exponentially. I have a much better appreciation of the effort to work through such problems, but also a much better understanding of the accessibility of deploying AI/machine learning solutions given the vast libraries, both proprietary and open source  (e.g., numerical linear algebra libraries) available to create solutions. I can appreciate much more how machine learning is used, and how I may use it, or discuss with others how they are considering using the technology to improve their lives or those of others.",5
670," Great course to learn the basic principles of machine learning. This course helped me to deeper understanding of the algorithms of machine learning and how to apply them to real world problems. The programming assignments took me sometimes longer than the suggested 3 hours, maybe due to my poor octave/matlab knowledge and although to the fact that English is not my mothertongue. But I wouldn't let out one single exercise. Just a slight recommendation according your tutorials and FAQs board. It would be helpful if you could clean up the boards and throw out questions/comments like ""I cannot upload my assignment"" because they have no relevance to other learners. Helpful are hints like ""if you get a value of 23 instead of 22 check the dimension of your xy..."".",5
671,"I love how Mr. Andrew Ng explains every course with so much detail and explanation, he even gave examples with some tricky case that later explained by him on how to solve it and how to prevent such case to happen if maybe later I find it. I already learned about machine learning (I learned about neural network back when I was a university student), but this course gives me so much knowledge, it opens my mind how to handle a certain case and which algorithm to use for it. It's a hard course and time consuming, to be honest, but I'm happy with the knowledge I learned from coursera and Mr. Andrew Ng. Thank you so much for providing this amazing course. I hope anyone who takes this course will feel the same and learned as much, if not more, knowledge as I do. ",5
672,"Although working as a product manager in an Internet related company for 3 years, I was still an absolute beginner of computer science world. However, by seeing all the influences that AI is increasingly bring to our life, I told myself, that is the future, and made up my mind to focus on this field for my future career path. Fortunately, I found this course, taught by a great teacher Professor Ng, which really open the door of ML world for me. I worked really hard for about a month to go through all the courses, and now, as Professor Ng also said in the last of the video, I am becoming the expert of Machine Learning, and I enjoy it very much. Thank for the wonderful course, and especially, thank you Professor Ng, I will keep following you along this path.",5
673,"Thanks you, thank you and thank you! Completing this course has been an amazingly enriching experience for me. It is not only about learning additional tool and technology but also a life changing event in my case as it gives me a new hope to think of machine learning as a very promising career option. Prof Ng has been so very kind to share his knowledge through this course. The course has been very well developed. The hands on assignments especially are so well structured that I felt as if a physical trainer is holding my hand and taking me through solving some of the difficult examples. This course is an example of how an online course should be. I am glad I came across this course. I thank Prof Ng and his team behind this course and wish them good luck.",5
674,"This is a very practical yet technically deep introduction to machine learning. It walks thru the most important topics of ML including linear regression, neural networks, and clustering. You learn the theory and math behind the algorithms, which is much more valuable than if the course just ""used a library"" and glossed over the implementation.",5
675,"The course provides an excellent overview of Machine Learning and the concepts and applications related to it. The course is at a high level and is a great introductory course for any executive who has to deal with various business projects that use some aspect of Machine Learning (whether it be pricing, marketing strategy, or analytical decision frameworks). To truly benefit from the course, it is helpful to have a good background in Math and Statistics (high school or college level background is very helpful in understanding the various algorithms). ",5
676,"This course offers an insight to most of the machine learning techniques currently deployed. However, it does not go in depth for any of it. Amazing programming exercises, very well structured, very helpful and easily understandable. They make sure that you only implement what is relevant to the course and all else clutter (reading, typechecking, etc) is already in place for you. The instructor is easily understandable and the presentations are very well structured. Coming from an engineering/computing background, would hope for more math and insights, but this is a course that can be taken by economics or other majors. Really enjoyed it and has prepared me to delve deeper into machine learning and craft ML systems as part of my school or in my free time.",5
677,"As a second year college student with very little experience in computer science, in the need of knowledge to accomplish certain activities, I found this course very interesting and fun to learn with. Explanations were clear and therefore easy to understand, quizzes were sometimes tricky but they helped me to realize I was missing some of the important information and so they made me review it, and so did programming exercises, which even made me more curious and fascinated about what computers are capable to do. Somehow this course let me knew that machine learning is indeed difficult but not as much as long as one is committed to invest time and effort into it. I am sure what I learned will be really useful to apply on my current and further projects.",5
678,"What a wonderful experience with video lectures from Prof Andrew Ng. I am from different discipline (chemical Engg.)  with  system identification & process monitoring background.  I am fortunate to have such an motivated prof. He made the machine learning topic so interesting that i am already in the process of enrolling  another subject in the same filed of same prof. .Though Machine learning had lots of maths, but Prof Ng made the subject so interesting with the blend of maths and practical examples. Also, i must appreciate the quality of the Quiz and Programing assignments so that we could understand the Machine learning algorithm very effectively.  Lastly i must thank MAHE, Manipal for giving me this opportunity to enroll in COURSERA.",5
679,"Overall, an awesome course. It covers many useful algorithms and approaches to machine learning, and presents the material in an easy to understand manner.",5
680,"
The course starts with easily comprehensible learning algorithms and 
proceeds to cover complicated stuff, provides a lot of formulas and 
optimization algorithms for training models.Intuitive approach is taken 
to make us understand various learning algorithms. Programming 
assignments are done in matlab/octave and use of vectorized 
implementation is stressed upon.  Course is mathematical, involving 
linear algebra (matrix operations) and calculus (partial derivatives) 
topics but some ""hard"" derivations are left out that is this course does
 not delves too much into mathematical rigour of proving formulas, 
instead focuses on usage of the formulas to carry out learning tasks.  
Overall, very beginner friendly and develops the concepts from scratch.

",5
681, ,5
682,I am so happy to have had the opportunity to take this course.,5
683,"I took on this course upon hearing some highly positive reviews and it did not disappoint at all. I have been fascinated by Machine Learning upon knowing about it and it is really great fun getting to the introductory part with this course. The curriculum looks great, well organized and well thought out, though I do not deem myself qualified enough to comment on it. Next, the instructor really knows how to teach and how to train. I wish I could work with this guy. Further, I would like to mention the all too necessary mentors' team without whom the journey would not have been this easy and smooth, specially Tom. So, if you are a beginner like me in ML or you are looking for your way around in ML, this course will be highly recommended from my side.",5
684,"Just finished the course. I'm a computer science student and already knew most of the maths, but I'm quite sure that this course is suitable for all people that are interested in this subject if they are really willing to learn about it as professor Ng doesn't assume mathematical knowledge of the student, so this is optional.",5
685," This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.  ",5
686,"I can't emphasize enough how valuable this course was for me. Andrew's pace and his ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms is above the average. Don't underestimate the energy and effort you need to put into it, but I can tell you it's worthwhile. Only the brave ones and a small percentage will make to the end :-) Prove to yourself you're part of the selected few :-) The exercises are well-balanced and the programming assignments were very nice elaborated so you can focus on key ML concepts, rather than basic programming you already know. What a thoughtful and nicely put together training. Andrew, you're not only exceptional on ML but also a role model on how online trainings should be elaborated. Congratulations is not enough! Cheers!",5
687,"This course is a good start for those who are reluctant whether to jump into this field or not. In my case, I'd worked in a role which provided me an opportunity to apply some techniques related to ML(Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, parameters optimization and prediction stuff. But as time went by, I felt that my means of working on those techniques was not a good practice and I should seek for some other ways to implement my model fitting and parameters tuning.",5
688,"Tried hard to complete this course around a year ago,  but pressures of work etc. meant I only made it around two-thirds through. However and despite this, I found the course to be amazingly well instructed with clear explanations and examples. Andrew Ng's skill and enthusiasm for teaching shines through. His deep knowledge of the subject matter is evident. The course is well structured with step-by-step lessons. Despite my failure to make it all the way through I found the course enormously useful at work as it re-enforced some things I already knew about and helped fill in the gaps in my knowledge regarding the variety of machine learning approaches. My ambition is have another go at finishing this course once I completed another related course!",5
689,Amazing course. Thank you Andrew.,5
690,"Andrew is a great instructor who explains complex subjects comprehensively with many relevant examples. My only critique would be that the programming assignments are relatively simple, since most of the code is provided for us to fill in the gaps. On the other hand, I understand that this makes the course more accesible to people without a technical background.",5
691,"As an engineer with over 25 years experience of developing and running models, the principle of parsimony (5 or fewer inputs) has become my watch-word.  I was sceptical that Machine Learning on 'big data' would simply be another area of applied statistics.  ",5
692,If only the dedactics of university classes had been this good when I studied computer science! Thank you for making learning a difficult topic as easy and as fun to learn as watching a Pixar movie!,5
693,"Excellent course! Gives you good practical skills to start applying the algorithms, but also just enough theory to understand them generally. I absolutely loved the programming exercises, they helped a lot to find out what I did not get from the videos. I also realize how much effort it must have taken to create these exercises and the videos, so thanks a lot to all who made the course!",5
694,"Andrew was a great teacher and the course was great. I already gave lots of feedback in another survey for Coursera so I won't go in to too much detail here, but I think a lot of great material was covered and that it was taught very well.",5
695,"This was my very first online course, and I have been away from the university for few decades, and I have not programmed for almost 20 years! Even though it was not easy for me, I was able to complete this wonderful course, due to highly organized course taught by Professor Ng, and the level of support from the mentors (special thanks to Tom), as well the reliable (for great part of the time) of Coursera infrastructure. ",5
696,"I have seen other machine learning courses but it cannot get any simpler than this. Most of the other courses will directly dive you into complex formulas and theorems. But Mr. Andrew Ng made it so easy for me to understand the basic concepts with his real world examples that now I can apply them in my own projects with ease. The evaluation system is also pretty good with hands on assignments. The quizzes were a little bit tough at times, but they forced me to go back to the corresponding topic and review it so that my concepts become clear. The assignments were also realistic and at times challenging for people using Matlab or Octave for first time. Thank you very much for this course. I hope this will help a lot in my career as a researcher.",5
697,"I enjoyed this course a lot. The material itself is very good -- as challenging as it should be to get you to learn the subject matter, with optional links to further material for students who wish to go deeper. Professor Ng explains it the material lucidly and comprehensively throughout the course -- his immense knowledge in the area is readily apparent even if we only study ""the basics"" in this course. The programming assignment are very good, and you are given every indication needed to understand the task, and to be able to complete it. Lastly, Professor Ng speaks in such a way that the course can be followed at all audio playback speeds, from 0.5x to 2x.",5
698,"As a person starting a new carrier,  getting back to math was a hard task. Several courses I went through before this one have been hard on my motivation .",5
699,"This is an excellent course for two reasons: first the video lectures are very good, introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner, and second the automated submission system is good at marking your (well designed) assignments.",5
700,"Outstanding course overall. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about machine learning to feeling very comfortable with it. In fact, I feel excited about the knowledge I've gained because it opens up many doors to learn more. I really appreciate the time taken to create the programming exercises, which I believe are a vital piece of the course as far as gaining practical skills goes. If I could have one wish granted, it would've been nice to also have a primer on the many data visualization and preprocessing codes that were written for us on each assignment. That would've given full knowledge to be able to implement the machine learning algorithm of each assignment and to be able to present the results professionally and programmatically. ",5
701,"Professor Andrew Ng , explained  various ML topics in a systematic and step by step modules and all the time makes the learner comfortable , even while explaining the difficult math behind the subject. For every concept of Machine Learning , he covered the math behind the concept to the extent that is required . Overall , this is an inspiring course, well organised, well delivered and keeps the learner highly motivated to make progress and to complete the course. The Resource Materials and assignment notes are of high quality with meticulous explanations and implementation notes. The feedback and learning through discussion forum was fantastic. My sincere and respectful thanks to Professor Ng and Mentors for organising this course so well !! ",5
702,"Excellent course for those who are interested in learning the ""secrets"" of machine learning !",5
703,"It is a very great introductory course to Machine Learning. In general, the curriculum is well designed, the explanation of Andrew is very clear, and the quiz in the middle of the video keeps me tune in to the lecture. I like how the quiz/review is changed slightly after our first attempt, so we need to understand the concept to get things correct, not only by remembering our previous answer and take another guess on the next attemp. After all, my favorite is the programming assignment. It really tests my understanding on the topic and see it by myself how things are running in my program. 5 stars for this course. (There are some shortcomings of the course, but they are more-or-less negligible compared to the overall quality of the course.)",5
704,"I thought the material was presented in a simple, concise way that made everything easy to follow. The presentation was often engaging and I very much enjoyed the flow of the course. I learned a lot by taking the course. It might have been nice for there to be more reference to the math underlying the problems, but I understand that that would make the course slightly less accessible. I would also have liked it if the programming exercise sheets contained (as optional material) a more detailed explanation of the functions and programmes we were provided, and explained how we might go about learning what those functions did and how we might be able to replicate them in different settings or languages. Thanks very much, this course was great.",5
705,Incredible course! It goes into the sufficient mathematical depth for each algorythm to understand and think about it. Apart of explaining each individual algorythm (except Tree based models) Andrew Ng gives you certain tips and things to avoid when developing both a single ML model and a ML project pipeline.,5
706,"Loved this course overall. Apart from a couple of tricky programming questions near the middle of the course, there were very few stumbling blocks once you put in the effort. The quiz questions as you progressed also helped keep the momentum going. Andrew Ng is a natural teacher and very clear in his explanations of what could otherwise be complicated enough topics. His humility really helps too. He really did demystify things. The examples of applications also helped a lot and were very interesting. This is the first online course I took that I actually wanted to work on. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a good overview of machine learning, and I know that the course comes highly recommended by people with PhDs in the area.",5
707,Exceptional content. ,5
708,"This is a great introduction course into machine learning! Professor Ng has combined useful material with lots of quiz and program exercises to reinforce our understanding. I love Professor Ng's teaching, especially even though he mentioned some additional study material (like calculus, linear algebra, etc), it is not necessary that we have to know each of such topic (although I took those courses in college, it has really been a long time) to continue the study in this course.   It is a great way to introduce someone to a new field. It gives me the opportunity to see what's machine learning is all about, then decide whether I want to proceed to the next level of this topic, and take those foundation courses to perfect my understanding.",5
709,Extremely well done and interesting course done by Andrew.,5
710,"After receiving several recommendations from my colleagues, I decided to take this course. I'm glad I made the decision to enroll. This course is an excellent introduction to various topics in machine learning. I had investigated a few other courses on the internet, and many of them were more akin to instruction manuals for industry-standard libraries. While it's important to know the tools of the trade to utilize these concepts in your career, Prof. Ng's course goes deeper into the moving parts behind machine learning algorithms, and offers an intuitive explanation for how they work. Overall, if you're looking to really understand machine learning algorithms at their core, this course is a great starting point. I highly recommend it.",5
711,"Perfect course! When I started it, I had no idea about machine learning and my programming skills were basic. I also did not have much idea of math or data analysis, so I doubted I was going to understand the lessons. But the course is so well structured, starting with the basics and going step by step to the most complex, that I managed to complete it successfully! I have learned to program in Octave (which I have found very useful), and I am already implementing some of the algorithms I learned to my personal and professional projects. It is a privilege to learn from Andrew Ng.  The assignments are somewhat hard, but you get a lot of help from the tutorials, mentors, and the forum. Thanks to everyone that made this course possible!",5
712,"A great introduction to applied Machine Learning. The programming exercises are very well designed and gently guide the student through ML concepts. The problem selection is very interesting and has practical applications such as character recognition, recommendation systems etc. Andrew Ng is a great teacher and makes learning ML topics, especially some of the esoteric ones, a pleasant experience. Highly recommended for someone getting started in the field of ML. You will probably get most out of this course if you have at least some understanding of statistics and basic programing skills. A refresher in linear algebra and matrices will be helpful too prior to taking this course, though it is also covered in the first few lectures.",5
713,"This is the first  Online course I have completed . I found the course bit tough, interesting and engaging .  Only difficulties i had faced  understanding the notations used in most of the supervised learning, especially for neural networks. However the concept i found pretty clear. Some topics i fond boring and very confusing but all are worth . ",5
714,"A very good initial overview of ML, together with some very good general advices on how to debug ML algorithms and allocate the resources to imporve accuracy in real world scenarios.",5
715,"I haven't met a teacher like him who has been so patient and explains everything so clearly and explicit. During my almost seven years' study in University in China as an undergraduate student and a postgraduate student, I felt uncomfortable. I couldn't see the path which I was going to walk. I didn't know what this major courses would bring to me and where they would take me to. I didn't know the meanings. And most importantly, none of the teachers and tutors care our student. NO ONE CARE. They only care about how much money they could get in some BIG program. ",5
716,"  Overall, excellent. Personally I particularly liked the programming as I've not coded for some time; Octave seems very powerful for matrix manipulation and this application. Lecture content is well paced (although I listened at 125%!). The lecture notes notes are good and with the reading notes were - in my opinion - better than the lecture slides at capturing content. I missed the reading notes in the final few weeks - indeed, the absence of these and the greater prevalence of repeating sections of the videos (Andrew presumably felt that these bits needed redoing) gave me a slight feeling that less care had been given to the preparation of these weeks' materials. But, again, overall excellent, especially as this is a free class!",5
717,"Amazing Course ! Not only it's very useful and covers many ML algorithms and concepts, but also very fun to watch and I really enjoyed the Programming assignments. I feel more informed now about ML and can roughly understand how some of the products using ML are built. Andrew is an amazing instructor who has great understanding of all the topics he covered and he carefully curated the course to cover all the important bits to understand the concepts leaving some of the in depth Mathematical deviations to get you equipped for practical skills. The course was so good that I actually want to learn more and will probably be looking at doing more of Andrew's courses. Highly recommended course for anyone interested in Machine Learning.",5
718,"The course provides a good introduction to machine learning. I will be pursuing other machine learning courses to expand my knowledge. The prerequisites state some background in linear algebra and some elemental knowledge of calculus. The course leans heavily on linear algebra and matrix operations. If it has been awhile since you taken a linear algebra course, I would suggest brushing up on the basics. The course uses partial derivatives, but you are not required to perform partial derivatives. You should have some understanding what a partial derivative is. The labs are essential to understanding machine learning concepts; applying theory from lectures to problems. I found the course enjoyable and the lecturer was encouraging. ",5
719,"Thank you to all of the people who worked hard on this course. I felt challenged, lost, excited and relieved at various points through the material. I especially liked the MatLab online environment for doing the exercises. The time I spent learning the environment was well worth the effort as the exercises reinforced a lot of the concepts for me. I found the quizzes especially frustrating because I felt pressured by the time constraints and unprepared for some of the concepts/nuances in the questions. I exit the course with a high level of enthusiasm for machine learning, excited to continue exploring the algorithms and math behind machine learning, and optimistic about my ability to continue in the field. Again, thank you all!",5
720,"A very interesting introduction to machine learning. The instructor is well known in his field and has a lot of practical experience that he shares. Very good presentation, very well motivated examples. Very good balance between covering enough areas with the right amount of depth, as far as I can tell. The math could be tough for somebody with only high school experience I would guess. You will see some impressive looking formulas, but still the concepts behind them are very well explained. Assignments are not easy, especially since they require using MATLAB, but instructions are helpful. Also, the assignments give a lot of insight and interesting scenarios to experiment with. I learned a lot and enjoyed the course very much! 

",5
721,"This course is excellent for those who want a theoretical introduction to Machine Learning and has some background with calculus. Andrew Ng makes everything looks really easy. The exercises are good because you can actually see things running, and they are not really difficult. Tutorials make them easy also. I wish the assignments were in Python although. Matlab/Octave is a programming language that you can't really deploy as an application, but they let you focus in the algorithms in instead of data structures. I now have a great idea about plenty of algorithms, know how to use them, know how to optimize them and can understand many materials online. Thanks Andrew, Tom and other people responsible for making it all available.",5
722,"The course covers core topics of Machine learning and Mr.Andrew NG has made sure that each student put significant amount of time towards understanding the theory behind each methods and how you can efficiently use it, which I found very useful as I am not an CS/IT graduates but this approach helped me a lot to get to the bottom of each topic and how to make most out of it. Course content includes review questions,quiz and assignments were very thoughtful like it stretches you to think about problems which in turn makes me a good thinker. ",5
723,"Professor Ng teaches thoroughly and clearly. Assignments had clear instructions and were easy to setup and submit (but challenging to complete, which is a good thing). The discussion forums were helpful especially the Tutorial section.",5
724,This course has provided a crucial stepping stone in my understanding and development of Machine Learning techniques and applications.,5
725,I really enjoyed the lectures the way he explains everything. And also the way he designed the course. I also liked the assignment structure and the skeleton given for the assignment to reduce the stress of figuring out everything and focusing on learning what needed in that part. Thank you for the tutors to already keeping the errate checked and updated the tutorial for exercise also. After some hair pull thoughts during exercises I am very happy to say I completed the course succussfully and i want to learn more dive deep in this. Thank you everyone who make this course and also keeping it free for everyone who want to start. And last but not least I want to thank andrew ng sir. Thank you so much for your effort and time.,5
726,"It has been a great experience taking this class. I very much appreciate the amount of effort spent on the material in the lectures, the quizzes, the prompt questions, and most importantly the programming exercises. ",5
727,"I highly recommend this class. It is an outstanding introduction to the topic of machine learning and it's focuses on the important details of it. I looked at slides of a class at my local university which issued similar topics, beginning with Linear and Logistic Regression, and I had trouble understanding the concept behind the math. But with this course you will understand the concept, the intuition and in the end the at least the idea behind the math. 
",5
728,"Excellent class. The lectures, quizzes and homework problems were very well designed to teach the material without having to write the entire code base for each problem. It was nice that the programming assignments and lecture slides were accurate, without typos or errors. I liked the feedback on the programming assignments and quizzes to give status as a student completes each section. The teacher is very clear and motivational. I learned, part-way through the course, to download the lecture notes prior to watching the videos. It helped with my understanding to see the lecture notes ahead of time. I also would sometimes download the programming assignments prior to the lectures to know what would be expected of me later.",5
729,"This is my first Data science course.  After completing this course, I now know a whole lot more about machine learning than I did before.  Now I feel comfortable that I can look at a problem definition and formulate a strategy to apply to correct ML algorithm.  The most important take away for me was the insight Prof. Ng gave us on debugging  algorithms using various tools like learning curves and ceiling analysis to determine where to put more effort in order to improve the over all performance in the learning pipeline.  Later this year, I plan to use what I have learned to solve a real life problem that has been bugging us for years.  Thanks Prof. Ng for designing such a wonderful and useful course.  It was a pleasure.  ",5
730,"The course is very good. It starts with basics and progresses into more complex concepts and algorithms. Sometimes the width of the targeted audience might result in very basic content for some or very advanced for others, but that content can be skipped or taken as a nice review by the former, and the main concepts are always stated clear for the latter. 
The explanations are clear, the examples pertinent. The programming 
assignments are carefully prepared and organized. They provide insight 
and hands-on practice, avoiding loosing perspective in implementation 
details and allowing concentrating in the concepts and algorithms. Mr. 
Ng delivers the course at a relaxed and casual pace, still showing reassuring expertise.",5
731,"From not knowing where and how to start the journey to venture into Machine Learning territory, this course has given me a lot of insights and ideas on what Machine Learning is all about. I have started my initial research on how to employ machine learning solutions using python. While python libraries provide a variety of models to start/work with machine learning, the underlying concept of each model was a big question mark to me.",5
732,"I learned a lot from this course not only about knowledge and skills, but also about how to be a better person. I completed all the quizzes and assignments with 100% marks and obtained concrete techniques to develop my own machine learning projects. I am a PhD student in Economics starting research in the near future. Hopefully, everything I got from this course will help me with my future career. The effort I spent in the past month will be paid off. I am going to keep up the perfect work on any tasks and try my best to achieve all the beautiful goals in the wonderful life. I would like to sincerely thank Professor Ng for providing such a great course and website. Knowledge is power. I appreciate Coursera for everything.",5
733,"Needless to say, one of the best courses I've taken, and learned a ton from prof. Andrew.",5
734,"I am a retired hardware engineering manager.   My skills entering this course were pretty rusty.    My software skills were minimal and I had forgotten most of my linear algebra.   I had to restart the course three times since I kept falling behind on the programming problems.   I ended up with a 98%.   The course is unbelievably relevant to today's business world.   Dr. Ng does a great job mixing theory and practice with an emphasis on practice.    The discussion forums are amazing and cover every question I had.  Tom Mosher is a great mentor explaining many of the difficult aspects of the programming problems.   I would give the course six stars if it had the rating available.   Thanks Coursera, Dr. Ng, and Tom Mosher.",5
735,I really glad that I have heard about Coursera the other day and trid to learn Machine Learning here. ,5
736,"From the very confused to have a good understanding of what ML can do with data.  On completion of this course, I can now implement supervised ML algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, Neural Networks, SVMs, and unsupervised algorithms like K-means, and PCA. I can implement the collaborative filtering gradient for the recommendation task. In addition, I know how to work with large data set by stochastic gradient descent, by chunking the data into subsets for parallel processing. Finally, I know how to use the learning curve to examine overfitting, underfitting, and use pipeline analysis to determine which parts of the ML system have more impact on system performance, so more effort needs to put on them.

737,"First of all, this course is a quality product: lectures are clear and effective and exercises are challenging enough. Perhaps the conclusion ""now you can consider yourself an expert in machine learning techniques"" is a slight exaggeration but, certainly, you are made aware of those techniques enough to think about using them effectively and getting some results.",5
738,Excellent course. Just superb. Prof. Ng is a great teacher. Completing the course I feel that I have an overall view regarding various ML algorithms and when and how to use them. I also have a more detailed understanding regarding the mathematics and process flow of the algorithms. Using Octave was great since you could focus on the mathematical solutions regarding the exercises without worrying too much of specific language oddities (Octave syntax is really simple). I have already started to implement the exercises using TensorFlow. I thought it might be a good idea to implement the same exercises also using some ML library now that I know pretty well how the solutions were implemented using simple matrix calculation. ,5
739,"An excellent course  starting from the basics of ML to its practical applications and also inspiring the student to apply the concepts in whatever type of activity they are currently involved in. Andrew Ng's narrative style, his command over the subject and the consistency in presentation from topic to topic is seamless and easy to follow. The quizzes and the examples using Octave/Matlab illustrate the the organization of ML tasks using similar APIs . And finally the examples give a good indication of how data should be organized even before we start ML work on it.",5
740,"Excellent course, very well thought out.  The lectures are paced well with concepts encapsulated in relatively succinct lectures. The explanations are clearly laid out.  The programming assignments are focused on the concepts with all the supporting code provided, and include excellent visualizations to see what is happening, step-wise confirmation that your code is working, and are interesting to boot.  As someone with a background in matlab and linear algebra I found the assignments pretty easy but are a good introduction to those not used to high level programming and keeps the bar of entry low.  It's not as rigorous as a typical undergraduate course but it was perfect for those of us who are not full time students.",5
741,This course is on of the best to start with for new comers in the filed of Machine Learning. The way Andrew Sir explains each and every topic with its mathematical aspects even without going deeply into its mathematical parts is simply magical. He truly cares for his students. He explains and guides about every things that we should/shouldn't do in order to better utilize our time while developing a ML system.,5
742,"Initially, I was a bit reluctant to take the course due to the maths involved. However, having completed it, I must say it was worth every single minute. The course explains in clear and understandable way the foundations of machine learning we encounter on a daily basis - like Amazon Product Recommendations, Netflix Movie Recommendations, Character Recognition, Text Recognition, Email Spam Classification, Fraud Detection, Photo OCR, and many more. It covers the algorithms and concepts commonly used today by BigTechs (like Google, Amazon, etc.) and other companies.  Understanding what machine learning is about fosters trust and will help (appropriately) apply ML to improve business and people's life. Excellent Course!",5
743,"Thank you for putting so much effort and thought into this course. It certainly made it possible for me to dive into the field of machine learning, and get a basic understanding of the techniques and considerations needed for tackling this subject.",5
744,"The Course if really a go ahead push you need for your journey in Machine Learning and Data Science, It is not only relevant to newbies but also could be related by good working professionals. The course content is 100 per cent satisfactory and the kind of interest and energy the Trainer has shown while teaching keeps you intact and interested to finish the course. Few things in the course requires little more attention so those are also pointed by the trainer and might need to revisit by us as well. Each concept is taken very seriously and explained in the same serious manner. Only ad-on to this course could been on python, but anyways the content explanation and content can be converted in python with some effort.",5
745,"Very clear It has a one-question quiz in the middle of every lecture, to keep you on your tows. I love also that it has a longer quiz at the end of every week, which helps you remember the material learned during that week. Also, having a matlab homework assignment, at the end of every week, helps you internalize the material.",5
746,"I was expecting an introductory course when I enrolled in this online course. I thought that I would take other machine learning courses after this one. However, the course quickly went deeper than I thought it would have. I was quite shocked because I started having trouble finishing the programming practices. Especially, because I am not entirely new in programming and I thought that this course would be a walk in the park. However, the course was enjoyable and I sincerely felt Andrew's passion and eagerness to share what he knows and experienced about machine learning. I really am glad that I decided to take this course and spent hours and hours and hours finishing this Machine Learning course. Thank you Andrew!",5
747,"This course is an excellent introduction to machine learning. Andrew is an engaging lecturer who uses good, practical examples to help with understanding machine learning concepts. My favourite part of the course was completing the programming exercises. I would like to have had a go at building a simple machine learning completely from scratch as part of the course, but the exercises were the next best thing (and, realistically, the best thing that could be provided through an online course). I would definitely recommend this to people who, like me, are just starting out on machine learning. However, if you're looking for an in-depth focus on just one area of machine learning, then this one probably isn't for you.",5
748,"Instructor is knowledgeable,  material prepared very well and presents by instructor in the way that helps to understand concepts and details.  Assignments are well prepared and matched with the subjects.",5
749,"I tried to make this my first online class, having taken the prerequisite math in college.  I quickly realized that my knowledge was stale and had to back up and take the entire specialization, 'mathematics for machine learning'.  Then I realized I was out of practice and had to back up and take the class, 'learning how to learn'.  So here I am, months later, finishing this excellent class.  The structure and flow of this class makes perfect sense, and the 'Aha! moments' are well worth the study.  Professor Ng teaches in such a friendly, understandable way that even when I had re-watch lessons, I didn't feel stupid.  Thank you Professor Ng and thank you Coursera for making this excellent class open to the public.",5
750,"I began to enjoy this course more as it went on. Although all of the mathematical notation and complexity confused me at the beginning, by the end I began to appreciate how Professor Ng explains topics completely. I was impressed by both the scope of the course and its complexity; I expect it will serve many people not just as an introduction to machine learning but as a field guide for the different algorithms, best ML practices, and error diagnostics. I especially enjoyed the programming assignments because they provided a (sometimes harsh) reality check on my understanding, while being both interesting and relevant. All in all, I have gained great value from this course and am extremely happy to have taken it. ",5
751,"The basics of Machine Learning explained in an easy to understand way. For people like me who are unfamiliar with Statistics the need arises from time to time to research certain things on your own. I would recommend just a little bit of familiarity with Calculus (i.e. derivatives) in order to better understand things, but certainly not necessary to make progress.",5
752,"Really solid course content, lucidly taught by Professor Andrew, at a pace neither too fast nor too slow. Got to learn a lot about octave, vector mathematics and a bunch of other stuffs apart from machine learning, which I may add, seemed quite real world and logically sound, in spite of being quite advanced both in terms of the engineering and mathematics involved. I can thank Professor Andrew only so much, but I must also add that the amount of materials available in the Resources and Discussion Forum, also helps this course to be one of the most enjoyable one that I have taken till date. ",5
753,"I haven't finished it yet, and will update my review accordingly once i do.",5
754,"The instructor is very knowledgeable of the material because it's so well explained. I've struggled to understand topics like neural networks and SVMs when I studied them individually but this course has given me a solid understanding of them through the incredibly clear explanation that doesn't assume prior knowledge. The programming exercises were my favorite part of the course, the way the code was structured and had the 'glue' already in there made it easy to plug in the parts you learn from the videos and see them work, and made me very excited to learn the topics in the course. I feel like I gained very valuable knowledge (for free too!) and that I will continue learning about machine learning. Thank you!",5
755,"Great course taught by an excellent professor, a true master in this field. The course worths the effort you need to put on completing all the assignments. If you are looking for a starting point to learn what's going on inside Machine Learning this is your course. A lot of high profile professionals that I personally know within the IT industry have taken this Prof. Ng lessons and, as me, all of them recommend this course as a perfect foundation for further and deeper studies.",5
756,"It was a great class for a ML beginner, the theory was valuable to get the knowledge of ML and deep details were often omitted - which was good for me personnaly as I would not be able to appreciate them anyway.",5
757,"I found the Machine Learning course very well structured.  The lectures were relevant and clear.  The resources and ppt was to the point.  The assignments were well constructed, enough to force us to think, and yet not tedious to get lost in mundane tasks ... in other words, they enhanced the knowledge further.  The Group Discussions were useful.  Reviewing past questions on the forum answered most of the questions.  And, where ever a clarification was needed, the Mentors jumped in to point us in the right direction.",5
758,"This course gives sSimple explanation of machine learning even for me as complete novice.  On other side I have finally understand why I have learned all that math on university and what is practical use of it. Professor Ng not only well cover algorithms but he gives very practical and useful advices how to implement machine learning. Without this course I will implement algorithms in completely different, inefficient way. Very useful are also advices how to judge does some activity make sense, how to track machine learning algorithm training progress and is it worthwhile to collect more training data. Definitively this is one of the best trainings I have ever took. Very well spend time. I highly recommend it.",5
759,,5
760,"I would recommend this course to anyone of any skill level.  The instructor, Andrew Ng is amazing and teaches everything at a level that is great for everyone simultaneously.  Everyone has the ability to complete this class.  There are videos at the beginning for those who don't know linear algebra, and many videos scattered throughout that have more complex concepts that he ties in if you have learned advanced statistics or linear algebra, for example, that are not necessary for the completion of the course, but helpful in receiving a more full understanding of the concepts.  He teaches advanced concepts in a very informative way that anyone can understand yet still challenges everyone.",5
761,"This is a very good introduction to machine learning. It covers a very broad set of material, and the lectures are very clear. The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material, making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material (in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course). It is very helpful to have some programming experience, and some knowledge of linear algebra, probability, and calculus. The course is very topical, so it does not go very deep into the material, but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications.",5
762,"Excellent class! Andrew Ng is a great instructor and he is very good at explaining the key ML concepts! The programming assignments are well designed and aided my understanding of various machine learning theories and practical techniques.Hoping for a sequel from Andrew, where he can teach more advanced subjects such as AdaBoost, regularization, AI interpretability, and common themes, patterns and foundations of various machine learning methods, which I believe will not only enable students to learn and appreciate EXISTING methodologies, but also invent NEW ones where needed. Proud to be Andrew's student  - ""Machine Learning"" is truly a 5-star class! My heartfelt thanks to Andrew and the supporting staff!!!  ",5
763,First time doing an online course.  It was well taught and Professor Ng is extremely engaging.  I was never formally taught ML and wanted to see what all the rage was about.  Now I feel that I know enough about the topic to begin thinking about and applying the techniques to my own problems.  I really enjoyed the MATLAB/Octave examples (appreciate Mathworks providing a student copy) and the real world applications and thought process of determining what is the most important aspect of the problem to spend time on.  Rather than a class providing rote memorization of algorithms and deployment this course taught a deeper understanding of the topics which is especially important in industry/commercial settings.  ,5
764,"This is an incredible course to build a solid foundation and get started in Machine Learning just from basic statistics knowledge. Professor Andrew Ng explains tough concepts with really clear intuitive examples. I found the course to be the ideal mix of challenge and reward. It is a very satisfactory feeling when you write a piece of code that start to learn how to recognize handwritten numbers, with just the right amount of guidance from the exercises for it to feel like you've really accomplished something. The course is incredibly understandable and engaging, with some background in maths and programming I went from knowing basic statistics and linear regression to being able to apply machine learning.",5
765,"This course is a must for anyone who wants to gain knowledge of what's ""under the hood"" of machine learning and is the best place to start one's machine learning journey.  The course presents the right amount of information on the math behind the machine learning and hence is suitable even for those that have limited knowledge in Algebra and Calculus.  The explanation on intuition about certain complex concepts are exceptionally valuable and drives clear understanding.  I am sure this course will remain as the stepping stone for machine learning for many aspirants to come in the future.  Thanks, Andrew Ng for this great course.  I will continue to rely on any Andrew Ng's course for further ML/AI learning.",5
766,"Very good course, proving a deep mathematical understanding of Machine Learning. ",5
767,"It was great one! Although I'm in a hurry because I have problems about imaging and sensing processing which want to solve with Machine Learning, I didn't know what I should do and learn at the first. I could get not only basic but also useful knowledge of Machine Learning and confidence according to finishing this course. Mr. Andrew's explanation was very familiar with me and his passion was so great! The proper exercises including the it's quality and structure also helped me. I'll use this ability to solve the actual problem by using various software frameworks. I want to take the classes about the actual implementation of Machine/Deep learning algorithm if there is his course. Thank you so very much!",5
768,"The course gives great insights into not only the algorithms which are required to be implemented for the various ML tasks at hand, but also into the finer aspects, like debugging of the ML process, finding out whether the hypothesis is high bias or high variance, whether the learning process is convergent or divergent etc. Andrew also puts emphasis on where we, as ML engineers, should utlize most of our time in the entire piplelined process of an ML application like Photo OCR, big data learning etc. Not only is this course good enough to be taken by those who are interested in this field, but is also good enough to be re-visited again and again for refreshing of concepts provided by Andrew so succintly.",5
769,"I can say this course marks a very good starting point for newbies in Machine Learning like me to continue exploring the beauty of Machine Learning. This is definitely not the end, but it is just the very beginning of my journey to deep dive into the world of Machine Learning.",5
770,,5
771,"Elementary to advanced in simple steps. Amazing how it is also built for students who start with no knowledge of the field. Nevertheless, after completion of the course I don't consider myself an expert on the field yet because I feel that I need to work through several more examples to become more comfortable, which is an aspect that could further improve the course (more workable and graded examples).  Also, the doubt clarification sections are also pretty amazing and very effective and responsive. Overall, I would give this a 7 out of 5 if I could! Thanks a lot! I hope I can approach the doubt clarification section in future about doubts that are from problems not in the course.",5
772,"Great course! A lot of material covered by the lectures. Each video is very clear and the quizzes are really useful to make sure everything is well understood. I'm glad that the assignments use Octave (even though I was sceptic at first and wanted to use python), it makes it really easy to quickly implement the algorithms and visualize the data. During the assignments, I appreciated the fact that we are deeply guided through every step of the exercises, especially for the first exercises. I think that it would be a little more challenging if we were a little less guided for the last exercises.",5
773,"difficult start , specifically to mastet the logic of matrix programming when you are used to loop over. However once you understand, it's becoming quire enjoyable to do complex operations using a single line of code and a few instructions. I like the way the course keeps repeating the past topics therefore slowly hard concepts become mastered. As I said the beginning is hard but find the training getting less and less difficult. The examples work out in the programming sections are very entertaining and things you alwa<s to know about it, movie recommendation, image recognition, neural network, spam filter, etc... I like the encouragement of the teacher as well that motivates you along the training.",5
774,"Professor Ng's course is undoubtedly the best Introductory Course on Machine Learning in today's date. This course is so well designed that everyone, whether they have any prior knowledge about Machine Learning, gets to learn something new in adequate depth. There are no words that can do Justice to describing the capabilities of Professor Ng as a teacher. He is arguably the most dedicated, hard-working and engaging teachers in today's time. In a short span of 11 weeks he has become the BEST TEACHER I have ever had the opportunity to learn from. This, again, speaks volumes about how phenomenal Professor Ng is as a teacher, since this course is a MOOC and there is zero one-on-one interaction with him.",5
775,"Lots of useful and insightful information from professor Ng. He's got an special way to share his knowledge. He never takes anything for granted, and goes painstakingly through all required explanations (except for the most advanced linear algebra concepts, but even in that case he provides application cases and pointers to the concepts).",5
776,"This course is really good because it provides the students with good knowledges on several investigated topics, together with many tools to compute hig-level processes with neural networks, and explains some important techniques and tricks to make your machine behave properly on pattern recognition. Despite not digging into the mathematical aspects too deeply for the sake of a better practice, anyway  it provides good hints and sufficient details to reach up for a full comprehension on the presented analytical items. The software apparatus is made for first-grade and expert programmers both. I wish to directly thank Dr. Ng for his efforts and for his fascinating and disciplined methods of teaching.",5
777,"I have tried and tested multiple courses on machine learning. This course's USP is the in-detail theoretical treatment of the machine learning algorithms with a focus on quick prototyping using a simple language such as Octave. Don't get me wrong - For my purposes, I always prefer Python to R and R to Octave. R and Python might have great ML libraries, but if you wish to get your hands dirty with the engineering behind those algorithms, the build, that is -  then Octave is great!. I think it's a much needed skill, to understand the design of these algorithms in greater detail. It's a more liberating experience than being reliant on limited degrees of freedom provided by some packages in R or Python.",5
778,"Very well made and interesting overview of machine learning. It won't make you an expert, but it touches on some very important aspects and tricks that may make you work much easier. Math in this course is not hard and even if you don't have any background, you will probably do well, because it's well explained (but not in detail, just basics).
",5
779,"I graduated in June this year, I am interested in Machine Learning earlier in my studenthood but my university didn't offer any course of the field, I found there are many on-line course on coursera including many ML course then joined courser in March, this course is great and friendly to newbie, I finished this course through several months, this course is my first finishing course on coursera. cousera was a choice for those who cannot go to college or wanna widen profession and knowledge. for me, I learned basic machine learning skill and knowledge in this course, Prof Ng's lectures are great, this course make me have a fundamental to go to advanced ml learning, thx to prof Ng, thx to coursera.",5
780,"Incredibly high quality ML class, with lectures that are comprehensive, practical, and insightful, with programing assignments that are thoughtfully designed and delivered with extremely high standards (I took the MATLAB online option), and taught by THE legendary AI scientist and practitioner Andrew Ng himself. ",5
781,"During my studies I’ve been taught many different machine learning algorithms, but I mostly understood them by intuition. This course focuses on just some of them, but it starts with basics and leaves almost no detail not explained with mathematics. Programming assignments ensure that every piece of the explanations is understood, as it would be almost impossible to pass them otherwise. I believe that advice on how to approach problems with machine learning, how to choose what to work on next, how to evaluate the quality of models, etc. or even unexpectedly acquired acquaintance with GNU Octave will prove useful in my future live.",5
782,"The Prof. Andrew Ng ML course is a classics, finally I made it to do the course. If you already have some maths higher education experience and optional Matlab knowledge from e.g. engineer studies, it is so much fun to learn all the machine learning concepts. The programming examples are very well structured and give lots of ideas how to play around and test yourself on additional ideas. All that said, by no way it is a requirement to have prior knowledge of the maths and the Matlab/Octave programming language. All you need is dedication and excitement for the ML topic. Prof Ng does the rest and he truly gives the best explanations on the Machine Learning concepts I ever heared - and you can get.",5
783,"This course filled in many gaps in my knowledge and was presented at just the right level.  I would estimate that it took about 4-5 hours per week to complete.  Dr. Ng is an EXCELLENT instructor.   The mentors/TAs respond quickly and the test cases are very helpful in completing the homework.  I never felt completely stuck.  I have been highly recommending Coursera to anyone who is interesting in trying an online class.  And I love (but don't believe) that in the last video, Dr. Ng states that anyone who completes the course is an expert in ML!  The enthusiasm and interest in the course demonstrated by Dr. Ng and his team of mentors is wonderful.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Dr. Ng and team.",5
784,"This course is legitimately the best course on Coursera! I had so much fun learning Machine Learning, a topic which I had some interest in, but wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not. However, I can say for sure this course inspired me to the greater things, to explore news careers in the world, to develop and creat news things that shape today's world. So for that, I only have no thank Andrew Ng for this wonderful class, and also the mentors, which always helped me in the most troubling times. For that, I can only say thank you, and if someone is reading this, and is still worrying if this class is good, then trust me, because it is certainly one of the best experiences you'll have with MOOC's!",5
785,"Surprisingly amazing and dedicated tutor I have ever listened and learned a lot. I just wanted to learn basic of Machine Learning, and now I think, I am an expert.  After spending one month of dedicated time along with my day to day professional work life, i gained more than that I think. All assignments asked me to refresh my math background, and it was satisfactory to submit assignment successfully. Only difficulty I faced on ""Collaborative filtering"" quizzes, and completed after several attempts.  I am willing to experiment and work on problem solving in real life using ML. This course is worth spending my time in every way, and Octave is an addition to my skills.",5
786,"As someone who is transitioning from academia to industry, I found this class to be extremely instructive and incredibly helpful. Although many of my friends recommended this course, I was still skeptical about this course's usefulness and effectiveness. However, I'm glad to report that this notion was quickly dispelled. This course has helped me understand the concepts of machine learning so quickly that I do actually feel like an expert in machine learning—although I'm sure that's not the case. However, I do feel confident that I will be able to quickly contribute to any machine learning project, which will undoubtedly help my upcoming job search. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Andrew. ",5
787,,5
788,"Since this is my very first online course, I don't have too much to compare it to, but I thought the lectures and the quizzes / programming problems were very focused.  Especially the coding where a lot of the ""grunt work"" was done for you, allowing you to focus on the actual machine learning algorithm which was helpful in grasping the application of these complicated concepts.  I especially liked the later part of the course where emphasis was made on understanding how to make educated decisions about where to spend time enhancing the performance of the ML code & training set.  This will save the potential ML student hours and hours of work.  Thanks to the professor, producer, and moderator(s).",5
789,"Thank you, Andrew Ng, for an awesome class.",5
790,"Excellent 11 week course, highly recommended and with real world relevance.. Very knowledgeable and personable lecturer is an effective communicator. Tutors are helpful and responsive. Informative discussions forum and helpful tutorial guidance and useful test cases. Guided programming exercises with Octave/Matlab in which the authors have done most of the grunt work, leaving the student to fill in a few critical bits.",5
791,"Fantastic introduction to AI and ML. Andrew Ng is an extremely clear instructor and I think this is the best resource online for getting started. Andrew focuses on the crucial and big-picture understanding of what you're doing, giving also very useful and practical bits of advice on implementation and application. The programming assignments are excellent and well worth digging into, not just for the parts of the exercise you complete yourself, but also the way things have been implemented. Thanks for putting the time into creating this wonderful resource - I've gotten tons of ideas for my own applications to neuroscience, and I feel empowered and eager to get started building my own projects!",5
792,"Te va explicando de una forma ordenada y detallada los conceptos matemáticos alrededor de las principales técnicas de aprendizaje automático: supervisado (""lineal"" y clasificación), no-supervisado y sistema de recomendación. Estos conceptos, aún siendo los básicos dentro de estas tecnologías, también son el núcleo donde radica su poder haciéndolos más que suficientes para clarificar y entender cómo funcionan estas tecnologías. Después, da una pincelada sobre tecnologías de aprendizaje automático más complejas que también están a la orden del día. Posteriormente, nos guía para lidiar con los problemas más comunes y sus posibles soluciones que nos encontraremos al trabajar con estas tecnologías.",5
793,"Thank you Dr Ng for your thoroughness in the lectures and the programming support staff for ther responsive and persistant help. For an economist with trading and risk management experience this is a very educational and exciting material to learn, in the hopes of one day helping to develop financial, statistical or trading algorithms in the Fintech industry. Also, very useful to internalize the concepts on your everyday quantitative and qualitative decisions for work or personal projects. Maybe adding, or just replacing Octave/Matlab with Python object oriented coding routines in the exercises can be more useful, since Python is a more used open source language now at days in many industries.",5
794,"This course is excellently paced, and well explained, making it not only approachable but also a very effective introduction to Machine Learning.",5
795,"Machine Learning course was really interesting. Actually the topic is vague for a new learner. But in Coursera the entire course is designed in such a way that we are more interested and eager to learn the next topic throughout the course. Even for a class room training it is difficult to be attentive for a long course like this. But in this online course I never get destructed because of the multiple activities like video, assessment, forum and programming exercise etc. Also multiple materials like pdf, video and title text were provided to revise specific topics whenever required. Above all the trainer Mr. Andrew was simply superb. We are luck enough to attend his class. Thank you Coursera.",5
796,"I really loved this class! Big thanks to Andrew NG, who delivered perfectly even for me, a non-native English speaker. I was particularly clear, interesting, and easy Andrew explained all the complicated theory and mathematics of the machine learning algorithms. Also, I would want to thank Tom Mosher and Paul T Mielke whose programming tutorials and lessons' FAQs helped me a lot in stepping through programming exercises. A piece of advice for non-programmers as myself: Matlab is way more convenient to use even though you need to pay for the license after the trial period. I highly recommend this course for everyone looking for expanding their knowledge in machine learning problems. Thank you!",5
797,"Machine Learning can sometimes be overwhelming to start with. But given time, we understand that there is nothing crazy about the subject but logic. Fundamental mathematics forms the baseplate and the necessary groundwork for inching towards developing something in the field of AI. ",5
798,"This is a GREAT course that initiated me into the world of ML. Having been out of math for a while, the first few weeks were a bit trying. However, Andrew Ng's classes were a blend of math, ML concepts and Octave coding exercises. I persisted, and by the mid of the program, this was becoming fun. The best part of the work week was to look forward to Andrew Ng's lectures. The last 4-5 weeks were absolutely fantastic since Andrew Ng combines a lot of examples into the ML concepts and makes it very applied in nature. Even as I was going thru this course, I was able to put many of these concepts to practice to real-world problems. Thanks to Andrew Ng for creating this material to get me started. ",5
799,I want to thank prof Andrew NG for the amazing course. It is by far the best course I had on machine learning,5
800,"I found this course to be quite interesting.  It was a great introduction to the topic, and it gave me an appreciation for the breadth of algorithms that are generally classified as ""machine learning"" algorithms.  Prior to taking the course, I had the mistaken impression that machine learning was more or less synonymous with neural networks, and this misunderstanding was corrected.  I really enjoyed Andrew Ng's teaching style, and even though I have a fairly extensive background in math, I appreciated his emphasis on applying these techniques without getting bogged down in proofs, etc.  I highly recommend this to those who are interested in getting a handle on the basics of machine learning.",5
801,"This course is an excellent beginning for anyone who'd like to discover the fantastic realm of Machine Learning. It is beginners oriented, but people who already have a certain level in mathematics will be challenged too. I really enjoyed the coding parts: guided, thorough and informative, with a lot of optional exercices to test one's comprehension of the material.",5
802,"The material is presented in a very simple manner, without removing from its depth and rigor; this course immediately made me understand more elaborate and mathematically rigorous texts, so I could supplement the course's curriculum as I went along; other texts that I used on the way were:",5
803,"Probably the best MOOC I have ever taken, it's one of the grand old ones, one of the first courses ever introduced on Coursera, before all that nonsense of 'specialisations'.",5
804,"Best online course I have encountered so far. I believe this is the best course for someone who is a beginner in ML or is trying to figure out if he/she is interested in it. For engineering student and CS students math is really basic and unchallenging. Most topics are explained conceptually and through many examples. Math shown here is just enough to explain what is really happening in the algorithm and what is behind all of it. I believe this is the best starting point for someone who is new to machine learning, and this course should give them enough knowledge to continue in their desired direction.",5
805,"This course is simply amazing, all the content from the video lessons, through the quizzes and the programming exercises are really well done, and also, there are really good mentors helping on the Discussion areas. If one with the will to really dive into these complex things to extract knowledge, I assure you, you will. The course is well made, but doesn't mean it's easy. I questioned myself through a lot of times in the beginning if I really was capable of learning all of this stuff. But I didn't give up, and well, this might be one of the most important decisions I've made in my life. This course aroused in me the passion to carry this knowledge, and keep improving it through my career.",5
806,"This course is really, really wonderful and would give it 6 out of 5 stars if possible. Mr. Ng is an inspiring teacher and explains things in such a clear, succinct manner. The world needs more instructors like him. I wouldn't consider myself an expert after taking this course but it did provide a broad basis to continue studying further. So many of the topics discussed during the course are super fascinating and I'm can't wait to dig deeper and hopefully one day contribute to the field of machine learning. The programming exercises were definitely challenging in the beginning. There's an expected learning curve.",5
807,"Thank you for a great course! A lot of credit to Andrew Ng for his huge knowledge, making the course very inspiring and with a good balance between theory, practical examples and exercises. The course also spends time on how things are applied in the real world. The forum has been a great help for me when stuck in some of the exercises, so thanks to the mentors for their time. As a software developer for 18 years I hope to be able to use Machine learning professionally in the future and I feel this course enables me to do so. The course does not include topics like Convolutional Neural networks or Reinforcement learning, so I will probably update my knowledge with other courses afterwards.",5
808,"You may be  a complete beginner in Machine Learning or may have already started your journey in Machine Learning domain by going through tons and tons of books or blogs or free online videos. But, this one course by Prof. Andrew NG ignites your thought process and provokes you to relate different concepts that we learn through different mediums (books/blogs/videos) and question yourself about your knowledge on these concepts and question the algorithm on why something is the way it is which is very much required by every individual to cultivate within himself/herself. I thank Prof. Andrew NG for sowing a germinated seed in my mind which I surely grow it with more and more thought process.",5
809,"Super course. Great teacher, focusing on the most important points and leading very well through the matter. Videos are very dense and neither too challenging or confusing nor too boring or shallow. Programming exercise are very well set up, give good guidance and are (in parts, very) challenging, nonetheless. The willingness to dive into linear algebra is an recommended prequisite.",5
810,"My first online course ever was Intro to AI (with Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig). All my online courses experiences afterwards were judged by this standard. I learned about this course from a colleague of mine. I am extremely grateful to Mr. Andrew Ng for setting this new standard of online courses for me and for teaching me the basics of machine learning and giving me practical homework in which to practice everything I have learned. The best things in this course were: the videos, the quizzes and most especially the homework system!",5
811,I would like to thank Prof. Ng and the Coursera team for an excellent course!,5
812,"Before I started this training, I though Machine Learning was something only a select group of people were capable of doing. I am glad I went for it anyway, because Andrew explained it really well, and I enjoyed doing all the exercises. I still think it's a difficult subject, especially neural networks remain a bit of a mystery, but it's all a lot of fun too. It gets fun fast when doing real world examples only a few lessons in. Things I though were way more complex than it turned out to be. I found myself watching videos and doing reading in lots of free moments and now I'm actually a bit sad it's over. Luckily there's always more to learn.",5
813,"Excellent, informative and fun introduction to machine learning. The programming assignments are carefully designed to incrementally ramp up the difficulty and the nuances of Octave/Matlab relevant to the assignments are explained beforehand. The quality is truly impressive, although I wish there was a little more  mathematical depth to some of the lectures. Many derivations and details of linear algebra were kind of glossed over but I understand that there's a lot to cover in a fairly short period of time so it is understandable (and most people probably don't mind it anyway). This is one of the few courses that really keeps me motivated to complete all assignments. Thank you, Prof. Ng.",5
814,"I love this course. This has been a life-changing experience for me. Prior to doing this course, I thought Machine Learning is too complicated a subject for me and I should pursue something easier. Going through this course I realized yes machine learning is a daunting and remarkably demanding subject, but I am perfectly fine with that and I can work with machine learning. This was possible because of how Andrew Ng broke down those complex topics into simple and digestible mini topics. His teaching style is otherworldly and more importantly, he is such a sincere teacher. I am grateful to Andrew Ng and everyone involved with this course for giving me such a wonderful learning experience.",5
815,"The information contained in the course is gold. The working mechanism behind the ML algorithms is explained in very simplified way. The mathematics is easy to follow too. Probably, this is the only course which explains maths behind ML algorithms, and it is very important. The assignments help to realize working of these algorithms. Support for Python and R should be included. Community and old students can contribute. The quiz, sometimes have ambiguous/confusing options to select from. The quiz can be extended to include computational questions. Prog Ng explain it very effectively. He is an excellent teacher. Overall it is an outstanding course and a must for any Data Science student.",5
816,"Professor Ng does an amazing job teaching complex concepts in layman's terms. He is patient, polite and encouraging...yes I got all those impressions from the videos ! You will come away with not just a list of key algorithms used in the industry, but an actual understanding of how these algorithms work. Knowing this, you can intelligently select the right algorithm to be used under different real-world circumstances. Finally, the support system to help you succeed is great; the Mentors on the site pitched in to offer help when I was stuck. I definitely recommend this course on Machine Learning and look forward to taking many additional courses on Coursera, especially from Professor Ng.",5
817,"A truly fantastic course. Extremely useful, practical, relevant content and examples, plus such a great teacher as well as very helpful course staff and other students. Thanks Andrew, team and the rest of the students.",5
818,"It's a great introductory class covering a lot of ground without diving too deep into each topic. It's just the perfect balance for somebody who is trying to find her way into such a complex topic. After taking the course I feel well equipped to start diving into various topics on my own and, perhaps, try to apply the learned material to some small real-world problems. I absolutely loved the fact that the instructor took the time to first go into the rationale behind each type of the algorithm offering good explanation of ""why"" before describing the ""how"". The practical advises on debugging and prioritizing various tasks can very well be one of the most valuable lessons of this course.",5
819,"I have a PhD in Neural Networks, followed the evolution of the science before it was called Machine learning. Our group at the university of Utah used to attend conferences and write papers. My PhD dissertation was applying Simulated Annealing to the learning of neural nets, adding Gaussian noise in all directions to help reach a global minimum, proving two theorems of convergence.",5
820,"Professor Ng is an amazing teacher, who explains the intuition behind mathematical formalism with extraordinary lucidity. I found this course to be thoroughly enjoyable. ",5
821,Thanks a lot for your course. I am a backend software engineer and one day I am willing to change my speciallity to data science. Your course is a very good introduction to this complex and very interesting scope and you provie a lot of theory and practice.,5
822,"Very good course. Good paced. Andrew is a great lecturer. A bit on the easy side for people with a background in physics or mathematics. If you have some experience in Matlab and have knowledge of linear algebra and calculus, most of this class will be quite straightforward and easy to understand. Despite that, I do believe a lot that is taught here is quite valuable, though as someone with a physics background, you may find a few areas over explained, but obviously, to account for people who do not have those similar backgrounds. I still find them entertaining and a good refresher nonetheless. If you do not have those backgrounds, I still believe you should have no problem following.",5
823,"Still in 2019 this is an excellent course on machine learning, being more than just a simple introduction, it explains fundamental concepts in the field, showing the deep mathematical insights, while still being accessible to the general public. If you already have notions of machine learning, linear algebra, calculus, and programming, this course will definitely help you clarify the hows and whys behind the design of machine learning systems. There is also so much insight to be obtained regarding the state of the practice of machine learning as an art. As the icing on the cake, Prof. Ng is probably one of the best teachers---in the pedagogical sense---that I've seen during my career.",5
824,"I loved this course! The course is not easy to follow for busy people. But Professor Andrew  makes it easy!  He delivered the subjects from user point of view, making it easy to learn the tools, never letting underlying mathematical theory come in the way! Personally, I can say that I learned contemporary Machine Learning tools. I am a Software Engineer, but I did not know Octave or Matlab. His lectures on Matrix operations in Octave were so good that I was able to follow the course. Standout in this course for me are these things: Easy delivery, separating Application from Theory, buttressing what is important to know, and his love for teaching! I am very grateful! Thank you so much!",5
825,"Sorry by the terrible English, i'm a Portuguese speaker =)",5
826,"I studied AI in college in 1994 and I haven't had much to do with AI in my career and decided to pick up this course thinking I will just pick up where I left off. I was mistaken. Machine learning is has progressed so far from my time that I felt like a complete noob. I also realized that I should've paid more attention during Calculus in college. That said, I have learned a great deal and Professor Andrew Ng has a way of making complex problems seem simple as he methodically explains and breaks it down into digestible chunks. Professor Ng also shared many insights that I am sure will give me an edge during my work on machine learning problems. Thank you professor. Highly recommended",5
827,"A nice introduction to machine learning in general. Explanation is clear. However, it unfortunately lacks popular topics frequently associated with machine learning such as deep learning and various types of neural networks. Instead, this course is mainly basic statistics and data science. Popular machine learning toolkits such as nympy, scikit-learn, and tensorflow should at least be mentioned or preferably with a hands-on exercise, but weren't. Given the long history of this course, additional (optional) materials should have been added to stay up to date with the state-of-art development in the field. Don't get my criticisms wrong: I say them because I want this course to improve.",5
828,"The best of this course (by far in my opinion) is how I learned how to accurately measure the performance of a learning algorithms, and how to know where I should spend my time trying to improve it. ",5
829,"The course is a great way to get into Machine Learning and it's safe to say that the pace ramps up quickly with programming exercises between Week 2 and 9. If you don't have any prior experience, the learning curve is quite steep and to have full appreciation of the math behind Machine Learning I would strongly recommend to fill the gaps in Calculus and Linear algebra at Khan Academy, I know it has certainly helped me throughout the 11 weeks. That being said, Andrew is a phenomenal teacher with well paced lectures and an approachable tone. Following the course I would recommend looking into Kaggle for some real life challenges. All the best Andrew and keep on sharing your knowledge!",5
830,This class is a fantastic introduction to  machine learning.  The concepts are presented using a clear and concise nomenclature that is easy to understand and provide a foundation to move on to more advance topics as the course progresses.  ,5
831,"This is the most Qualityfull Course in Coursera besides of Deep Learning Specialization... I've got My Best Teacher/Instructor and Motivator from Coursera and Dr. Andrew Ng is that Person... You help me to choose my path of life by Your great teaching of Machine Learning and Deep Learning... As i ended up My Deep Learning Specialization and Machine Learning Coursera of You, I'll Miss You Very Much Sir... I was Emotional when i end up last video of You....... You and Charles Severence are the Best Teacher in my life so far... I'm doing my final Year of Graduation in IT but afterall You two are the Best Teachear and Motivator of My Life ... Thank You Very Much May God Bless You .....",5
832,"I am a researcher working in the field of wind energy aerodynamics from the University of Stuttgart in Germany. I took the course mainly because I miss my time being a student, but also to be able to make use of machine learning approaches in my field. I love the course especially corcerning the lecture materials and the videos. These have made me understand a lot easier because many cases were given practical examples and simple analogy to other cases. Furthermore, the programming material is comprehensive and the mentors were always helpful. I would love to keep learning from this course! ",5
833,He is a good professor and a nice person. apart from some double sided question answers and complexity of learning how to work with the system everything else is top notch. I liked to see some more videos on SVM implementations and some programming exercises aiming directly at implementing the algorithm or even some more info on how to assess properties of an image but probably they were out of the scope of this course. He is an amazing teacher and I have loved machine learning more and more. i enjoyed the course apart from programming exercises (that is just me making mistakes) but mentors especially tom mosher was there for me. MOST IMPORTANTLY I don't regret taking this course.,5
834,"Although this course was recorded in 2011, I have found it incredibly valuable.  Professor Andrew Ng presents exceptionally well providing a strong logic and clear thought allowing you to follow along and understand.  Additionally, due to the fact that this was recorded in 2011, I think allows people like myself who don't have much experience with the ML topic to learn the basics as it was taught then.  Many times, topics get very confusing as they grow and evolve.  The level of information and concepts presented are fantastic and I've gotten so much out of my time and efforts.  Thanks to Professor Ng and all of the moderators and mentors that are still active answering questions.",5
835,"I liked the motivational emails and messages in this course. Also the videos are selected and reviewed, to be the best content for teaching. One can see the huge work behind the materials. Professor Andrew Ng has a very good approach of explaining deep technical issues, and it just focuses the message on the relevant pieces of information, which honestly, i believe will remain in the long term memory. As a side note, I liked his way of telling ""don't worry about it"", regarding complex mathematical demonstrations. This somehow comforted me regarding feeling bad, since i forgotten some maths since the university time ( i only applied such notions rarely in my developer daily tasks)",5
836,"Andrew is an excellent tutor, I would recommend this class.  It was really good fun.  The level of mathematics needed varied quite a lot across the various topics so be prepared to complement this studying with further reading between weeks.  I was initially sceptical about bothering to learn Octave but that didn't take too much time and I'm glad I did because it helped very much with understanding the concepts taught here.  Andrew was right when he asked us to trust him on that!  Having completed this class, I shall purchase the certificate today and look to continue with the deep learning specialisation next.  Thank you, Andrew, a thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile investment.",5
837,"This lecture was really helpful to learn Machine Learning for beginner! I've already recommended to my friends who are interested in ML, and I definitely recommend you who are considering taking this course! The videos are really well described to understand the concepts, and it was not really boring to take this course, because of exercises which are given for almost every week! Each exercise is really exciting to experiece practical problems like hand-written digit recognition, spam mail classifier, movie recommender systems and so on. Finally, I want to say thank you to the instructor, Andrew Ng for providing this great course! I learned really many things from this courses :D",5
838,"This is a really great course. Andrew Ng explains the concepts extremely well, developing intuition before a more mathematical explanation. The emphasis is on understanding the key concepts of machine learning and being able to apply them in programming assignments. I found the programming assignments made it all real and therefore worth the effort to learn Octave/Matlab. I also enjoyed learning  to think in vectors/matrices rather than for loops for the programming work. Although the course is now a few years old, the content is foundational and everyone who has a serious interest in machine learning should know know this content - and this course is a very good way to learn it. ",5
839,"This has been a best-in-class introduction to the world of Machine Learning. I have had so much enjoyment, and learned so much throughout my time in this course. From the closest a beginner can get to the mathematical proofs of Neural Networks and Backpropagation, to the practical and real-world advice on deploying, diagnosing and optimising models and their predictive powers, it has been a life-changing experience to gain all of this understanding, truly enlightening! I will continue to dig deeper into trying to understand advances in the field in research, and the applications of these tools in industry to bring value to people's lives. ",5
840,"Very good overview of the key techniques and applications. I come from an economics background, so much of the first half (especially on linear regression and logistic regression, or what we called ""logit"") was essentially a review. But it was a helpful review, and good to see a new perspective on the key concepts. Other parts were genuinely new and enlightening. Programming exercises were challenging and informative. Quizzes could have used a bit more feedback on wrong answers (some of them the answers were explained, others they weren't), and some of the lectures seemed to spend too much time explaining things that were already well explained. But generally a great experience.",5
841,"Thoroughly impressed by the teaching. I smiled when I saw the question  ""what is a pipeline?"" and one of the options to answer that question was ""It is related to plumbing (HAHA)."". Programming assignments are relatively medium difficulty, not too hard.  People who have done some work in python with data sets and matrices should have no issues. I had a course  ""Information Retrieval"" in my Masters to which I can relate most of the programming exercises and concepts like F1 score, precision, recall, parsing text from a document, Elbow method, etc... Overall it's a great course for anyone who is looking out to start a career in  Machine Learning.",5
842,"It's really an amazing course, tough but interesting. At the Begining, I start with doubt, since AI is a so 'hot' topic nowadays. Then, I spend arround one month and half to finish all of classes, as the time goes, I have to say machine learning really shocked me. Of course, ML is not a perfect way to solve all problem, but it's a powerful approach to make our life better. I think I will take further courses from Andrew Wu (Ng). Furthermore, I am really touched by Ng, he is a really amazing teacher, who sincerely shares all knowledge about ML, and I do feel his pure purpose of 'making this world better'. That realy notices me about the first code I implemented, 'Hellow, word!'.",5
843,"I strongly recommend this lecture for Koreans. Becuase it is very easy to get the concept of various machine learning tecniques.  But before you(Koreans) take this lecture, I'd like to give some useful information for them. ",5
844,"This was my first course on coursera and I very much enjoyed it. It is very well structured, Andrew explained each topic in a very intuitive way, and I feel like I have a very good idea now of what machine learning actually is and how I can apply it to real world problems. However, the coding exercises tend to be a little bit too demanding (at least at the beginning) if you only have little experience with Octave's programming language and if you are not trained in econometrics/statistics. More (optional) coding examples might be helpful at the beginning. Nevertheless, this is a great course and I would recommend it to anybody interessted in machine learning! Thank you, Andrew.",5
845,"As long as you know a bit linear algebra, programming, math, you can start learning machine learning. and the course is actually very cool. if you can applied what you learn from this course, I believe you can build a pretty cool system that do great things. The assignment is well-designed that you only have to focus on the part which is relevant to the course content rather than purely programming. The instructor Prof. Ng is also good, able to explain things clearly. After this course, I still want to learn more about machine learning or related stuff. All in all, this course is great and I would recommend it the anyone who is interested in and want to learn machine learning.",5
846,"This was a fantastic course on machine learning. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, who is also willing to devote the time to the class materials. I've taken many courses in my life, and this has certainly been one of the best. ",5
847,"Prof. Andrew Ng's presentation is pretty intuitive and effective. For me I've almost forgotten the Linear Algebraic after graduated for years, but it is still easy to 100% understood what he taught. The exercises are also designed very practical for us to better understand the lectures, and I think I can deploy them for my future work as well. This learning series is really helpful and seems open an window for me to understand Machine Learning, since I thought it would be very very hard to understand before attended this series. By now, I am proudly to say that I am in the room of this great discipline. I really appreciate Prof. Andrew Ng's effort as well as the support team.",5
848,"Very detailed and practical course with many practical programming examples that I did really enjoy. After completing the course I am willing to go back to the materials and the optional exercises to try and make my own machine learning experiments. Furthermore, if there is something I liked from this course is that you are given many good examples and tips to apply to machine learning.",5
849,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic instructor, plain and simple. His straightforward teaching style makes learning the basics of ML highly accessible. The programming assignments teach you how to implement what you are learning right away, and the optional exercises really allow you to take the basics to the next level. ",5
850,"Great course, especially for math fans. You'll learn basics of machine learning which is a great foundation for further personal improvement in this area. All the basics is explained why is it the way it is. Every question that I might have while watching videos was answered in some of future videos. Knowledge testing is done in a way to ensure that you really understand what was talked about in videos. Especially programming exercises where focus wasn't on matlab or some really advanced mathematics, but on stuff necessary to understand subject exercise was covering which is great for people who don't have as much time as they would wanted to dig even deeper into the matter.",5
851,"I enjoyed the way Andrew Ng applies equations and algorithms with practical and modern examples. He goes straight to the point. It helped me to understand the main Machine Learning concepts quickly. I think the first 3 chapters were a little bit boring since they cover mathematical notions that seem far away from Machine Learning. However, these chapters were essential for me and provided great pillars for the subsequent chapters focusing on neural networks. The assignments were challenging, especially the one covering the back-propagation algorithm. The Matlab's online platform is very straightforward to use. It helped me to stay focus on implementing the required answers.",5
852,"I really enjoyed Andrew Ng as a Professor. His easy to understand accent, his down to earth approach, and the overall content of his class. I will certainly take more classes with him. He was an inspiration and the class gave me a lot of new ideas that I will apply in the next start up. THANK YOU!!!",5
853,"This is one of the finest course on machine learning. Their content of videos, teaching style, service is great. Many will fear maths part in machine learning, but coursera simplified it to a great extent and teaches intuitively. Most important thing which makes this course unique is the application of concepts. It is important to know where a machine learning fails and it is important to know what is the right technique to apply at the right place. All such boundary cases are explained at great depth. It is important to learn a technique from different perspectives. Andrew Ng explained different perspectives of various techniques which can be learned only from experience.  ",5
854,"Good overview of Machine Learning, covers the basic algorithms (NN, SVN, LR etc...) and goes a bit more in-depth in the math/linear algebra. In addition to that, there is a lot of concepts crucial  to apply ML correctly being covered (datasets/testing/eval/data collection, optim etc...). Not my favorite programming language for the assignments but still nice to use for the linear algebra capabilities. Even as someone that has been using ML for a few years there were some interesting connections between different topics being made to which I didn't pay much attention until now (similar math principles, vectorization even for ""simpler"" models sur as linear regression etc...) ",5
855,Wonderful introductory course on Machine Learning!,5
856,Best Machine Learning course in the entire internet. I have personally completed the curse and i can say that the way he teaches is aswm. This course is less about the programming but very good for knowing how the machine learning algorithm actually work. and what i think is if you know the concept of how algorithm work then you can program it into any language. There are some other machine learning course but they are more focused in how to perform machine learning algorithm in language such a Python and R they don't actually explain how algorithm work. So what i would recommend is first complete this course on machine learning and then move on to other course. Thank you. ,5
857,"This was one of the most comprehensive course on the web, that takes you from basic to practical level exposure! I've been going through so many tutorials as well as in my own university, but the systematic approach and attention to details even while giving assignments, is commendable. More specifically, there was direct link between what was going on in the class and the assignment, which helped understand the topics as well as helped see it performing on actual datasets in practise. Most of the time, the huge amount of time is consumed in the background work than actually coding the machine learning stuff in universities, which was well taken care of in here. Thank you!",5
858,"I constantly take classes and read books to acquire new skills. ML turned up to be a complicated issue - it was very hard to find a well-made resource to study ML. After several trials (with different books and manuals) I felt like a failure, that it was my fault that I couldn't understand it... and then I found this class. Well, I had several instructors in my life that I admire and now there is a +1 on this list. Thank you, Prof. Ng, you are a truly talented teacher. And I also want to thank you for creating this fully automatic course that now allows so many people to pick up ML and be able to apply it to their field of work! One of the best courses on Coursera indeed!",5
859,"This is very useful course, I've learned a lot of new information about machine learning and metods of applying supervised and unsupervised learing algorithm, methods of checking its performance and carrying out error analysis. This course have many practical advices on how to save your time during solving machine learning problems and how to manage your recources in a right way. You can find some practical tips that will help you to work in more efficient way. The lecturer explains every topic in an easy to understand way, always adds some examples for better understanding.  So I have enjoyed this course a lot and I would recommend it to everyone interested in the topic.",5
860,"Prof Ng makes the tough ground really accessible. One of the things I loved the most about this course was the effortless integration of teaching multiple skills at one go. The course covered Octave/Matlab basics, best practices and practical issues, related but not strictly covered content, while still imparting clear understanding of applied machine learning and enough theory to start making applications.",5
861,Very good course with lots of valuable advice about application of different strategies and how to approach obstacles that can occur applying machine learning.,5
862,"This is one of the best online courses that I've had till date. This course covers the breadth of Machine Learning, which gives a very nice outlook over the subject. The syllabus was systematic and the learning for each week was always motivated in order to solve particular problems. The programming exercises for instance, were quite involving and really exciting to solve. For me, no amount of superlatives can describe Professor Andrew Ng's and Coursera's effort in providing top level education to the people.The entire course was like a journey for me. Well, such was the course that it actually left me quite emotional post the concluding video by the professor. Thank you! ",5
863,"Highly recommended if you want to acquire a working knowledge in this area.This is probably the most difficult course I have ever survived and one of the best taught. Specifically, by providing the students with working learning machines or almost working learning machines that require some specific actions to make operational, Dr. Ng and the mentors tie the conceptual lesson from the lectures to working hardware. It would take years to gain the working experience that this course offers if you needed to assemble these machines on your own. I am incredibly impressed (and grateful). An added benefit was new perspective the course offered on familiar statistical procedures.",5
864,"This course by Professor Andrew Ng is undoubtedly the best place to get started with machine learning. It gives you firm understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts of machine learning while keeping it simple which many other courses fail to. Professor Andrew Ng makes everything seem easy and keeps learning interesting until the very end of the course. Besides being very knowledgeable and a great teacher, he also has a very humble and charming personality which makes learning much more fun. ",5
865,"Very good course for machine learning beginners. If you are new to ML and are in search for a good resource to start with, look no where this is the best course till date on ML. This is because teaching Dr.Andrew Ng gives a very good intuition about different concepts in ML and also since the programming assignments are in Matlab you need not worry that much about the implementation and focus on understanding the algorithms. The only downside of this course is much of the mathematics is abstracted from you so and only final results are provided. but you can always google it and understand on your own. That said I enjoyed this course and will highly recommend it to others",5
866,Excellent to understand the key concepts and also the techniques to get started on Machine Learning. Prog. Ng has been excellent in visualising the student journey from lectures to mathematical concepts to coding techniques to assignment instructions and tutorials to help solve the assignments.,5
867,"Wonderful experience with the course under the guidance from Professor Andrew Ng.
",5
868,"The Last 4 minutes of Andrew thanks us for completing the course is one of the most effective videos I have ever seen. After this great course, great syllabus, great hands-on experience, great Whole life skills he thanks us for taking the course. We really who must thank you, Andrew, for this course. Nothing wrong with this course. It can move your entire career life to a different place if you do it the correct way. Again, thank you. ",5
869,Thank you for your commitment! I really understand the Machine Learning stuff thanks to you guys.,5
870,,5
871,"This course is simply amazing, it treats advanced mathematical models for ML in a way that make them accessible to anyone regardless the background. Also Andrew is really clear and you can see the passion for ML shining through his face as he speaks, and this is a great added value that motivates you as nothing else!",5
872,I had a little experience working with SVM to classify hand gesture by analyzing surface EMG signal. It was my first ML related project and after this course  I can say that I did many things wrong and had spent all night wondering what can I do to improve my system. It was a group project and my job was to find a way to analyze the signal and produce useful features to train a classifier algorithm to distinguish hand movements. Our plan was to create some sort of a prosthetic arm. That project worked some how  but I have realized there were so many things I could have done better. This course has motivated me to start that project again and improve it's performance. ,5
873,"This is actually my first online learning class I was able to finish. What it means is that the class material and Professor Ng's lecture were interesting and inspiring. It somehow kept me going while it was definitely not the easiest class.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see the abundance of tutoring and Q&A resources for this class, where the mentors answer questions (sometimes the same questions) in many different ways. It was very very helpful. Also, I guess the fact that many other students (around the world, it seems) are taking the class together makes me not want to quit. I felt like I was studying and struggling together with them. Overall, great class!",5
874,"Professor Ng is amazing!  I love the way he is so positive and simplifies the lesson into basic components.  Don't be fooled, this class is hard!  But you will learn the most powerful learning algorithms by a thought leader in the field.  The format of the class is awsome.  Video lectures with quizes followed by a end of chapter quiz and programming assignments.  The only area that needs improving is the auto grader which basically says you either failed or passed (no other feedback on whats wrong).  The mentors are there and provide the help you need and are very responsive. Thanks again for this amazing course that propels me into the Data Science world (for free!)",5
875,"This course is designed for beginner-level learners. Through this course, you will somehow have  a clear picture of what's going on in machine learning (including a bit of deep learning e.g. neural network). It doesn't require much high level of math knowledge to complete this course, and the matlab practice is definitely worthwhile to give it a try. You're also more than welcomed to examine the codes written not for the exercise, and that surely helps you better understand how Octave or matlab works. Overall speaking, it is a good course and navigates you through the fancy world of machine learning. Good thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for providing this fabulous course. ",5
876,"This course is a great practical introduction on the machine learning and its application. A lot of material is covered in about as much depth as is possible in an 11 week part time course. For people that complain the course is not rigorous enough, I dont think its realistic to expect more than this from a short online course, go and take an ML masters program. The course also introduces a lot of mathematical concepts that, if you want to get a very deep understanding of, you can read up on yourself which I think is fine. The programming is not challenging for those with modest experience but is probably not appropriate for someone who's never written code before.",5
877,因为英文水平有限，所以基本上全程都是看的中文字幕，课间练习和课后练习基本上都是查词典和用Google翻译来完成，有的时候做课后题需要很多次才能达到80%的成绩。经过这段期间的学习，让我对机器学习有了初步了了解，也从老师这里学到了很多以前没有听到过的知识，让我觉得无论将来能否实现自己儿时的梦想，都会很感谢老师的课程，感谢老师让我看到了另一个“世界”。在14年底的时候，从网络上看到了一些有关人工智的新闻后，第一次感觉到我似乎可以通过学习人工智能有关的知识来实现自己儿时的梦想，但从未涉入计算机行业我，迷茫、困惑，甚至身边的人视为我是一个与现实世界脱轨的人……从第一次看美剧星际之门SG1，我就向往着将来有一天，可以让人们远离各种疾病，可以通过计算机来修复人类的身体上的缺陷（儿时的梦想是想治好我哥哥的癫痫病）。所以从网络看找到很多有关编程的书籍包括资料，但是学习的时候却发现自己似乎越走越远，基础学过后，就转到了制作网站，制作手机APP，可这并不是我想要的，也正是因为如此，我放弃了一段时间……但初衷并未改变，所以我在知乎上看到了关于老师的简介和针对课程的一些说明，我想我终于找到一个可以让我真正去改变自己的老师了。而且我的一些想法在学习的过程中也产生的了一定的改变，无论将来的结果是否是自己想要的，我应该选择不放弃，哪怕我不能实现，却也因为曾经为此而努力过，不悔。最后，再一次深深的感谢老师，我会坚持下去的，即使平时的工作再忙，身边的人还会有异样的眼神，也不会轻易放弃了，因为是您真的让我看到了一个崭新的世界，等待着我去探索，去追寻……谢谢您。,5
878,"Excellent Course to deep dive into basics of Machine Learning.Andrew Sir has been absolutely fantastic and brilliant with almost everything he does : -the way he teaches complicated concepts with absolute ease and class, the way he presents the topics.... Brilliant Brilliant course to take. Just got a feeling that the programming exercises can be bit more lengthy and should allow students to do more tasks and write codes bit more from scratch. All and all a fantastic learning experience.One thing I would do like to mention is that it would be more helpful if decision tree and random forest algorithms are also incorporated into this already fantastic looking course.",5
879,"It was exciting journey following Andrew week after week. At the end of the course, if only I was there where he is, I would have loved to give Andrew a warm hug and said ""Thank you man..""",5
880,"Brilliant course. Masterfully taught, very well structured course that makes optimal use of the online teaching format, and teaches a lot of actually applicable skills if one's willing to put in the effort. I'm kind of at a loss for superlatives really",5
881,"A shockingly pleasurable way to learn what is honestly an otherwise challenging course, with non trivial insights into material.  Andrew has a gift for making material seem tangible, his slow methodical approach for key concepts is offset by hand waving away unnecessary overhead, thus one never feels bogged down with details, and always thrusting forward on the fundamental drive of this course: a general overview of Machine Learning.  Do yourself a favor and start the course; and if you're even moderately serious about using this skill set, put the dollars down, do the assignments and get the certificate, because it is a LOT MORE APPROACHABLE than you might think!",5
882,"This was the most challenging online course I have ever taken, but the most interesting and useful one. It took me weeks of hard work and late night coding sessions, but was such a fantastic experience to discover new ways of thinking about problems and solving them. I felt really proud to have built a neural network from scratch.
",5
883,"This class required a lot of focus for me, I strived to do the maximum amount of work and understanding so that I really maintained and understood the content. If this approach is taken you will get an unbelievable value in the knowledge gained. The forums have lots of good stuff, and the lectures while not 100% perfect, are totally awesome and small technical glitches do not detract from the course in any way. I also thought that even though people complain about it not being in Python that learning Octave was very useful and really showed me the power of highly vectorized implementations and the speed benefit they can bring over typical programming techniques.",5
884,"Excellent introduction to machine learning. The course material is easy to understand, the program has a linear learning curve, and the assignments are very well designed, so it's easy for the student to double check their understanding and to apply their newly-learned knowledge to realistic scenarios.",5
885,I am week 9 of current course but I already feel so good about the subject. The content covered by Professor and the ease with which he has gone over such complex subjects is beyond commendable. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. ,5
886,"This course has two primary strengths: Prof Ng, and the Coursera platform.  Prof Ng style and proficiency combine for a very pleasant and effective learning experience.  I've rarely felt so validated without also feeling a little placated.  The Coursera platform (and the corresponding Matlab experience) are well organized and intuitive and helpful.  ",5
887,"This course was an excellent introduction to ML. Andrew Ng, the instructor is great and the mentors answer your questions in just a few minutes. Definitely worth taking the time! The first 8 weeks have a programming assignment, some may be hard and take hours to figure out but DONT GIVE UP THE CLASS!! use the tutorials on the resource tab if you are struggling and lookup the discussion forums for others that have had the same questions as you do. With these resources you will be able to complete the programming assignments which are the toughest part in the class. Also, take hand written notes, use colors, they always help me sink the information in for longer!",5
888,"I loved this course. There is nothing really complex, it's a very good overview/introduction of a huge topic. I came here with no prior knowledge, so it was perfect for me. When I finished the course I felt like I had gained a deeper understanding of the subject and I wanted to dig into some parts for more details (e.g. Neural Networks or Anomaly Detection). ",5
889,"Andrew gave a wonderful introduction of the basic models for supervised and unsupervised learning, took us through many real life applications, taught us how to deal with tuning the model to improve its efficacy (e.g. rule-of-thumb ways to pick up parameters, error analysis) - all great advice. Andrew has a very considerate way in introducing sometimes very technical details to make the course material suitable for a wider audience. Thank you, Andrew! Also the course quizzes during the video and after each segment are great. The programming exercised were carefully crafted to help the students to capture the key modules in his lecture. It's an excellent course. ",5
890,"The course has been a pleasure. Professor Andrew Ng introduces the course in a systematic way, explains concepts clearly and elaborately. The quiz questions during the video and at the end are intriguing and helps you understand the subject better. I am very happy that I came across this course. I hope he makes course material for on many more specialization topics for machine learning. ",5
891,"Excellent course. As a data science/machine learning practitioner I think this course conveys the intuition behind the algorithms, which is oftentimes obscured in a heavily mathematical layer in advanced texts. Intuition is fundamental to know what to expect and how to get a sense of what the algorithm does, and is often achieved through equations and several days of thinking about it until it becomes second nature. With this course, this process is accelerated and you can get the grasp of complex algorithms by following the lectures and the homeworks. It has been a tremendously rewarding investment of time, and definitely a must for practitioners at any level.",5
892,"I can highly recommend this course to anyone interest in the topic of machine learning. The course not only provides a nice and broad overview of the topic, but also offers some well prepared programming tasks that are easy to work through helping to deepen the understanding of the courses content. Moreover, Prof. Ng offers useful advice for practical application of machine learning throughout the course. However, for my taste the lessons could assume a higher level of the basic knowledge of mathematics of the attendees, which would get some lessons more to the point.",5
893,,5
894,"This course not only introduced me to machine learning concepts but also exposed me to understand the the basic working of things like how is it possible for a computer to  say what tumor is likely to be cancer or like how does a my mobile scanner recognizes sentences written on a page etc. More, importantly I've seen the mathematics that I knew implemented in completely different scenario with so much of success. I'm happy that I have been able to do all the assignments. It is worth mentioning that  contents of the lectures only start to illuminated once the assignments are done. This is the first online course that I've taken and this proved to be worth it.  ",5
895,"Outstanding course!  One of the best learning experiences I've ever had hands down.  One of the things I really liked were the Octave programming exercises; the fact that you could complete them in parts and then submit to see if you got each section correct.  I also really like the fact that this course teaches you fundamentals and helps you to understand the theory in an intuitive manor, as opposed to just a wrote memory of how to run some algorithm without really understanding details.  I could go on about many other subtle details, suffice it to say that I'll be taking many more Coursera courses taught by Andrew Ng as fast as I can cram them into my head.",5
896,This was my first online course in Machine Learning. I should mention that I thoroughly enjoyed doing this course and can say with conviction that this will be my field of study in the years to come. I want to delve deeper into this field. Thank you very much Andrew Ng sir for making me understand the concepts in a crystal clear manner through your videos. I have seldom come across such kind of excellent pedagogy and teaching style throughout my career till date. I would be very interested in knowing about all career options (such as in education sector/corporate/any other) related to this field. I want to be associated with Machine Learning for a long time.,5
897,"This was an excellent course in machine learning and gives a comprehensive introduction to key concepts and algorithms. The programming assignments were challenging but they really helped to solidify the material of the lectures. Also, they were presented in interesting and fun ways that kept you engaged. Some sections were very difficult due to the complex subject matter, especially the sections on neural networks, but the lecturer explained the material well and with work, they became clearer and understood. Although the lecturer tried to simplify the mathematics, a student really needs a good understanding of mathematics to get the most out of the course.",5
898,,5
899,This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera.  I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon.  I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video.  Professor Ang explains the material very clearly.  I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the videos or in the discussions.  I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a good understanding of Machine Learning.,5
900,,5
901,"I think this course is a very good starting point for anyone to step into the area of machine learning. I am a graduate student who is trying to combine the techniques developed by the machine learning community with classical problems in computational fluid mechanics. I enrolled this course because I encountered too many unfamiliar concepts while exploring the literature. Though this course is mathematically too primary for me, it still provides me sufficient knowledge on the new concepts I need to understand. After finishing most material in this course, I am finally able to read the literature on the edge. Hope my review might be helpful to someone else.",5
902,Exciting course! Astonishing work to develop all videos and prepared files and guidelines for programming exercices. ,5
903,"Great introductory course! My favorite part must be the assignments. They're complicated, interesting, compelling and complete. Lovely course altogether, although the final weeks are quite short. Andrew gives not only the techniques to put together working algorithms, but also many useful suggestions to monitor how your programs are learning and what you should focus on next. My only regret is that in the unsupervised learning section most of the math was completely overlooked, but I understand this is not the aim of the course. Highly suggested, definitely enjoyed and most definitely a course that can be taken even with not a huge amount of time every day",5
904,When I started this class I had only the fuzziest notions about what machine learning really is. By the end I had a solid understanding both of the underlying mathematical principles used in machine learning and of the practical considerations for applying it to real world problems. I really enjoyed Professor Ng's lectures and the course mentors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The programming exercises did a lot to reinforce the week's material. The time estimates are pretty good too which made it easier for me to organize my schedule and get all the work done. I'm very happy with the course and looking forward to using machine learning in my projects.,5
905,I have researched a lot and I sincerely feel courses taught by Professors are the best way to go and learn any new technology or science.,5
906,,5
907,"If you have an interest in ML and don't know where to start, then this course is for you. Even though the course was designed and launched in 2012, this looks fresh even today. Don't worry that the course is not in python, but the fundamentals are made very clear. So once you become strong in basics, you can try your hand implementing various ML algorithms in Python. The theory portions are explained beautifully and you get the know the Mathematics behind every algorithm, which will improve your understanding of the particular algorithm.",5
908,"This might be the perfect introductory course to Machine Learning. It goes over the main ML algorithms in detail and devotes a lot of time to carefully explaining the maths behind in order to grasp how the algorithms work. The videos are comprehensive and very well-explained, the quizes are relevant and useful, and the programming exercises are challenging, without being overwhelming. Furthermore, the additional resources and the help provided by mentors in the forum are of great help. I'd totally recommend this course to anyone interested in grasping the big picture of what ML is and, more particularly, understanding the nuts and bolts of how it works.",5
909,"This is a well-structured introductory course into ML, covering all the basic topics. The matlab/octave programming assignments made a huge difference in terms of how much I learned and how much I end up retraining. I know there are many canned ML software packages out there, now that it is 2017, but there is no substitute for knowing all the nuts and bolts of these algorithms and techniques. As somebody with no CS or ML background, I was able to learn so much about ML from this course in such a short time span. I would very much like to commend on the effectiveness of this course. Lastly, thanks to Prof. Ng and all the mentors helping us along the way!",5
910,"This course is so enlightening. Before I was too lasy to learn anything about machine learning. I have always been curious about NN and PCA but haven't got a chance to learn it systematically. It's time consuming to go to the class and it's hard to pick a 'right' class if you want to learn online. This course is the perfect solution to both of the issues. Not only is Dr. Ng's class straightforward and easy to understand, it also provides me the opportunity to code myself. Most importantly, I can take this course with a flexible time schedule. Thank you for providing this ML course for us, Dr. Ng. I really like this class and I appreciate your teaching. ",5
911,"Excellent and very deep, fundamental course on machine learning. In this course you will learn how to implement selected machine learning algorithms from scratch. Although there are many high-level libraries which offer to do the maths for you, I believe that learning the algorithms from scratch gives much better understanding of their application.",5
912,"This class can be an introduction to people who are beginners of this field. To me, it gives me some basic concepts of machine learning, and a better understanding of how it works. Andrew is an attractive person who can encourage you to be fond of this course. For the public with different background , the mathematics of this course has to be easy, but the actual situation is that you should be good at calculus，statistics，linear algebra，convex optimization and so on, although most of them I have touched when I was a freshman. if you want to go deeper into it. There is still a long way to go!! In summary, I love Andrew, I love this course, and I love ML ",5
913,This course opened my eyes on how valuable and structured information can be extracted from large datasets. ,5
914,"This class showed me the algorithm behine maching learning, which I was looking for. ",5
915,Having questions on -Will the content would be worth the time?-Will there be a rigored learning approach-Will this be the goto online course for machinelearning.YES!!YES!!YES.The programming language used here is octave/Mathlab.Do not just have this as a condition to look for another course in this domain.SInce learning curve of ml is all you get from this course and trasition of implementing from here to in python is just a wave about.Let me also tell you something I wish someone had told me in beginning.The instructor is cofounder of coursera.It has become that famous that you cam to cheoutthis.SO the man must have made the best MOOC and it is true.,5
916,"Very comprehensive course in machine learning area. The course illuminates me of how the machine learning plays an important role in our daily life and how can a machine learning algorithm to help us to build a better system. Besides, the course tells me how to train a machine learning model not only focus on collecting the data, but also try to think of the variance, bias of model itself, and try to consider about the cell limitations of each procedure in pipeline of model. What's more, it tells me how to balance the limited resources with the different kinds of situations you probably meet when you are trying to develop a machine learning algorithm.",5
917,"When you are getting started in learning or creating something new, a little help can go a long way towards making your work easier.This course on machine learning is very well structured.I especially liked the questions that appeared during the videos, they made the learner apply their mind to the present. The algorithms were explained with relevant real-world examples.Programming assignments were well-organised and their difficulty level was optimal(neither too easy nor too difficult).The resources section with comments and tutorials has been of great help in time of need.Thanks to the courser team and hope that Andrew Ng continues to great things.",5
918,"The best part of the course is that having been taught by Professor Andrew Ng himself, the course has the right proportions of the segments that should be taught to the new learner. Seems like Professor Ng did his ""CEILING ANALYSIS"" for this course and knew where to spend most of his time and efforts. I am an undergraduate student and a beginner in Machine Learning and hope to see myself in the silicon valley with the big minds of the industry and help shape a better world. Having said that, I am proud to have started my machine learning career from this course. ""Perfect blend of information that is needed and that can be coped with for a beginner !""",5
919,"This is so far the
best online course I have found on Machine Learning. Dr. Andrew Ng is one of
the best instructors I have experienced. His command on subject matter and
style of teaching is truly amazing. He starts the topic from very basic concepts
and gradually transit into most advance concepts but students never lose their interest.
For students the comfort level remain the same in the advance level as it was
for the basic concepts. I will strongly recommend this course to anyone who is
planning to start their carrier in Machine learning. This is so far the best
course you can find online and it is FREE. What else you can accept. J  ",5
920,"i love this course, really admire Andrew Ng, he is one of the greatest teacher i've ever learned. i will remember the way he explains everything in  such a clear-cut manner, although english is not his mother tongue,  which truely inspires me in keeping learning new things. Before this class, i was an amateur at computer science who was long for understanding the concept of machine learning, and this course didn't make me disappointed, i've learned tons of helpful lessons from this. Finally, the wrap-up final video genuinely touched my heart.... thank you for spending your time making such a great course... thank you for being teacher in this class.",5
921,"This course was definitely a career changer.  I am at the point in my career where I need a paradigm shift.  Andrew Ng is an excellent instructor.  He built the class on the mathematical foundations of Linear Algebra, Matrix Math, and Partial Differential equations.  Once I saw the matrix math, it instantly resonated with my engineering background, and allowed me to get up to speed with ML.  In addition, another point Andrew emphasized was the idea of building an algorithmic project plan, and testing the hypothesis before deciding on an algorithmic approach, and expending a lot of effort.  Again, this resonates with my Systems engineering training. ",5
922,"Muy buen curso. Se nota la ganas y el gusto de enseñar del Profesor Andrew, por lo que eso motiva a seguir avanzando en el curso y aprender aún más de lo que se ve aquí. 100% recomendado a cualquiera que le gusten estos tópicos, incluso si no se tiene un conocimiento muy acabado de programación o de matemáticas elementales. Destaco también la labor de los tutores que tienen una gran disposición a ayudar a través del foro. Sin ellos, todo hubiese sido mucho más lento y complicado. Los recursos, así como del foro y los tutoriales son de suma importancia y, a mi juicio, están bien diseñados para que los estudiantes realmente puedan resolver sus dudas.",5
923,"5 stars, highly recommended",5
924,"This is a great machine learning class. The most highlight in this class, I think, is that it not only teaches you a lot of machine learning theories and algorithms, but also it walk you through plenty of practical concerns about how I should implement a real machine learning application myself. Furthermore, I really like the programming exercises provided in the course. Each of them are so well designed, so that I can have a chance to really work through the algorithms taught in the class. I appreciate the course so much. I would recommend this class to everyone who has a keen interest on machine learning and wants to learn it from the beginning.",5
925,"This course from Andrew Ng is the best online course I have ever taken! If you are interested in machine learning and want to understand how all the ""intellegent"" algorithms learn and work, this is the perfect class for you, as well as for everybody who looks for a good intro into the machine learning and artificial intellegence field. Andrew is one of the best teachers I've had, he explains stuff very clearly and makes sure you truly grasp the intuition behind every concept or formula.",5
926,"Thank you Andrew for introducing me to machine learning. Having very meager experience in programming I never thought that I would be able to finish it but I managed to work my way through. It took me much longer than 11 weeks but I could do it in the end. You are an exceptional teacher and have made many of the difficult concepts very clear. A few topics are clearly marked optional , but I strongly recommend not missing out on the linear algebra matrix classes, specially for someone like me who has been out of touch  for a significant period of time. Being a medical doctor by profession , I would like to use the concepts in the field of medicine.",5
927,"Really great. As a math major, some of the material early on is too slow but the pace is certainly good later on after neural networks. If you feel not challenged enough, you can always think about why something is true while Andrew describes them. And if you have enough experience of linear algebra, Andrew makes reference to many aspects of it in the course for you to think over. There may be some repetition between different sections, but that helps with drilling the important facts into you. Also, the whole course as taught at Stanford is available online with the all the mathematics put back in and so you can always go visit there if you wish.",5
928,"This is a great course that explains the basic concepts of machine learning in a way that makes perfect sense.  Although you do need some maths to complete it, the important points are covered in the first weeks, and all of the formulas are explained really well so you get an intuition for them.  The way the material is presented, you see how each new concept relates to simpler examples you have seen, to the point that topics like artificial neural networks and back-propagation make perfect sense.  The course is also packed with advice on application and provides you with a complete set of tools you can use to debug and improve your own projects. ",5
929,"Though lacking in mathematical details and rigor of proof, Prof Ng does an excellent job in introducing machine learning concepts for people without mathematical or programming background. I highly recommend the course as a starting point for students interested in Machine Learning without any background in advanced mathematics and programming skills. For those who have engineering or scientific background, the course still serves as a good review of key machine learning concepts, although the course is best supplemented with other sources for better understanding of some of the equations and concepts since they are sometimes given without proof.  ",5
930,"Excellent course. You will learn about and apply many concrete machine learning algorithms (neural networks, linear and logistic regression, anomaly detection and others). The programming exercises are crucial: it's where you actually see whether you have understood the videos. The exercise sheets are very detailed - you can tell that the teaching team knows where the pain points are (e.g. vectorization). If you want to go deeper into the mathematics, check the corresponding Stanford course (CS229). My favorite part of the course is all the tips and tricks on how to apply machine learning in the real world (e.g. error analysis, ceiling analysis).",5
931,"Absolutely amazing! I had a chance to study Machine Learning in 2002 for my master degree. After that, I worked for a couple of big companies here in Brazil, but unfortunatelly I didn't have the opportuny to keep in touch with ML. In 2014, I decided to start my own company to help people to transform their business with their data. So, this course fits like a glove for me. I definately will buy the certificate to try to encourages people like Andrew to make more courses like that. Andrew you're absolutely fantastic!! You have the gift of teaching and you're helping a lot people that are involved with ML. So, thanks and regards: Guilherme Timoteo.",5
932,"I have a bachelors degree in CS from a prestigious university, which means that I was familiar with a lot of programming/mathematical constructs covered in this course. However, I never ventured into the field of Machine Learning, since I concentrated on other CS fields - and ended up graduating with no ML knowledge and a view that I would probably not get an opportunity to work in this field again. With this course, that changed. I don't see myself as a competent ML engineer with just one course, but this course has provided me a great entry point into an amazing field. Thank you Prof. Ng, I hope every science discipline has a teacher like you.",5
933,"this is the best online class I've taken. I can see how much effort has been committed to design the class, construct exercises and providing proper guidance. I have the feeling that every time I have questions while listening to the course or reading instructions in the exercise, I would definitely be able to find answers in the next few minutes in the video or in the next few lines in the exercise. On rare cases, I would be able to easily find answers in the forum. This has been a superb learning experience and has been a very efficient way for me to make use of my time. Great thanks to Andrew and all the teams behind this fantastic course!!!",5
934,"Thank you very much for bringing this amazing course into reality. The course is very detailed and very intuitive. Professor Andrew is very very nice and has a very expressive way of speaking and teaching. However it would be great if the level of the assignments are not too easy (maybe it's easy for a certain purpose). As a computer science student, I am a little bit uncomfortable because of too much details are provided (I think it would make student less adaptive and flexible when facing new problems, where they have to work all the way from scratch). And it would be perfect if less mathematical details are omitted (as optional parts maybe).",5
935,Influencing my high score is the fact that the level of this course was perfect for me: challenging with only a small handful of frustrating moments and that will of course vary from person to person. What I can say though is that I found the materials were very high quality. ,5
936,"Amazing course, from top to bottom. As an aeronautical engineering with a little experience in programming using Matlab I suppose I had all the required background to tackle the mathematical and numerical ""tough parts"" of the course without much difficulty. I'd say that for someone who knows nothing about calculus, algebra and programming whatsoever it might get a bit too uphill.",5
937,"I found it to be a very complete course, both in its theoretical content and its programming practices. When I started this course I had a vague idea of ​​what the world of machine learning really is, however as the weeks passed I felt that I had significant growth on this subject, to the point that I was able to read and understand technical articles from different areas of engineering. As well as its application in my original training area (geosciences). Finally, I want to recommend this course to people dedicated to science, engineering, finance, etc. I believe it will be a valuable component in your professional and research performance.",5
938,"Outstanding course.  Simply phenomenal.  Crystal clear and detailed explanations throughout, pitched at the right level.  Awareness from instructor makes it possible to complete course without in-depth knowledge of linear algebra and calculus, although more complex derivations are provided in many places for more familiar students.  Programming assignments are challenging, but well specified; they are broken down into manageable steps, and hints are provided to help students overcome the most common pitfalls.  Student who complete this course will come away with the expertise required to implement and refine the various algorithms with skill.",5
939,"I'd like to begin by saying that for anyone looking to dive into machine learning and gain a thorough knowledge of some of the major machine learning concepts used today, this is the perfect course.",5
940,The course is great. It is very well structured and the programming assignments help very much in understanding the concepts and developing practical skills in order to apply the methods taught in the videos.,5
941,Extraordinary course. Look after the first week you may feel what are you doing? Is octave worth learning? why should I learn in octave when I had done so much to learn python or R? Won't this be a waste of time?,5
942,"This is an excellent course on Machine Learning. Prof Andrew is a great teacher and spends a great deal of time going through specific examples. The working through of examples better enabled me to understand some of the subtleties in the various learning algorithms. This would be hard to achieve otherwise if I had went to read a book directly. Furthermore, Prof Andrew spends a great deal of the course discussing the intuitions behind various concepts which makes me have a better appreciation of the various concepts. Finally, Prof Andrew is very encouraging which further spurs students like me to persevere through this rather lengthy course.",5
943,"An outstanding course.  It starts out a bit hard, especially if you aren't very familiar with Matlab/Octave as I wasn't.  But the challenge is worth it.  I feel much more confident in my understanding of many of these algorithms.  I think, though, that after week 7, the class gets a bit too easy and routine, especially with the programming assignments.  I was looking for something either more in-depth and/or challenging.  I also would have liked to see topics like reinforcement learning covered, or further advice about how to design machine learning pipelines.",5
944,Splendid course with a lot of valuable information and precise balance between math and algorithms! ,5
945,"This course is perfect for every Machine Learning aspirant. Though It took me way long to complete it, It feels great when I finally managed to do it. Every video had in-depth insights over many small details of the subject. The programming exercises were very challenging as it was new for me to visualize things in a vectorized format, but I was amazed to see that such a beautiful technique exist! In conclusion, I would really like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng from all of my heart for making this course. It definitely had changed my perspective on Machine Learning and I will always use the course  videos as a great source of reference material.  ",5
946,"This course is very useful for people who care mostly on practical aspects of machine learning. Andrew covers rather difficult subjects of machine learning in a very intelligently easy way so even an average student with minimum background in math and linear algebra can learn the machine learning techniques and use them. I really appreciate the time and effort in making the programming exercises which helped me significantly to understand the  structure of a working machine learning program should be from loading data, training, cross validation and test for real applications such as email spam and digit recognition applications. Thank you.  ",5
947,This course is a great start for somebody who wants to know more about machine learning. ,5
948,"I consider that it is a great course, with a very good methodology. The professor was very clear with all the lectures in the videos, also the way to evaluate was really good, with that way was possible to confirm everything that was learnt during the videos. I got really impressived with the way of submit the solutions of the programming excercises. I would like that the course have more mathematical theory, it is good to see the process of derivation or demostration of some formulas, I understand that not all people have the same mathematical knowledge, but for the ones that are interested on that it could complement very well the course.",5
949,"Amazing course for me. I am a Computer Science grad working for last 4 plus years as a data analyst and software developer, who does not have decent knowledge of the specifics of Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, but very curious to learn. Especially, supervised learning, unsupervised learning and artificial neural networks are few things I always read on famous papers, but this course helped me learn them in detail with hands-on experience with some absolutely amazing examples. I would like to thank everyone who put their efforts and time for this course. This could help generations to come, to learn basics of Machine Learning. ",5
950,"This course is very good, I liked this course, learned new techniques. But in this course should to explain the diferents evaluations in the residuals (errors), like is normality test (Durbin watson or Shapiro Wilk), heteroscedasticity test, multicollinearity betwin model's features (VIF). I am profesional stadisticst , and if i search one model with very accuarcy , good pronostics , but this model fails with the diferents test so this model really is not very good.  Also i understand that this course is for diferents people in many jobs camps, but  is necesary at least talk about this tests. For the rest this course is very good. Regards. ",5
951,"I would like to thank Andrew for this fabulous course on machine learning, it was appropriately challenging yet still easy and interesting enough to follow. Even for non mathematical person like me who is not too good with statistics, I was able to follow the concepts. The review questions and programming exercises helped me to solidify my understanding with these concepts too. Coursera would offer such high quality online courses for free is amazing, and makes me feel more confident about learning more on other topics online too. Thanks to all the tutors who helped out with the questions I raised also. It was such a nice journey. Thanks. ",5
952,The guidance and knowledge received from Mr Andrew Ng was really great and shall always remain with me for the rest of my career.,5
953,"Substancial content and signifcant level about machine learning, so a certain amount of work is expected to achieve this course. However, as it is brilliantly taught and mastered, what should be complex appears almost simple. The exercises in Matlab/Octave are automatically checked and the support given by the documentation and the mentor is exceptional, so you never feel alone. As a consequence this course put me back on track to software development, after a pause of 16 years. 2 months after completing this course, I have defined the blue print of an ambitous research project  in C++ from home. To resume outcome: viral research spirit.",5
954,"My work is electrical equipment diagnostics in metallurgical plant. Sometimes, we have a lot
of technical data and have no idea what to do with them. Now I understand how
to make simple algorithm which would predict, for example, the chances of some
AC motor will be working properly for next month. And maybe, it is enable to
improve high voltage cable line diagnostics with partial discharge method (which
gives us a lot of unlabeled data) to predict risks of short circuits. Now
machine learning doesn’t seem to me something very complicated, I want to learn
much more about it and maybe this will help me to change my carrier. Thanks a
lot!",5
955,"I do not have a frame of reference of taking another ML class but think i can safely say Dr. Andrew Ng's class here is One of the absolute Best. His lucid explanations coupled with the practical examples and exercises were just outstanding in helping with the understanding of the concepts. Many thanks also to the mentors and contributors to the tutorials and discussions in the resources section. These Coursera table-stakes truly made this an outstanding experience. Most of all, a truly sincere salute to Dr. Ng's humility, patience and thoroughness in the subject, which I hope will help me in my own personal and professional advancement. ",5
956,"It was quite helpful :) Andrew looks like a fun and chill teacher and I enjoy his pacing (even though I mostly play vids at 1.5 speed). Great bite-sized intro to ML, but I want to do the assignments on Python since it's probably the state of the art right now. I know that the deep learning course is currently teaching in python, and I know that octave used to be good, but I think this might course might need a rehaul to update on the most recent ways of doing ML right now. It's an ever changing field tho so it's hard to keep up. Anyhow this class is great and I'd really recommend it to everyone looking for a way to get started with ML!",5
957,"Incredibly useful. I had never taken an online learning course before, thinking that my university courses more than had me covered in my career as far as machine learning was concerned, but this changed my mind and was so stimulating it kickstartarted my desire to keep learning and gaining knowledge on the topic. ",5
958,"I
really am looking forward to pursue a career in Machine Learning. I've always
adored Andrew NG in his research, deeplearning.ai, Google brain and his other
ventures. His insight on this topic is just stellar. The way NG introduces his
topics and how the course goes about teaching them through the programming
exercises helped me achieve an erudite understanding of the concepts.  I've already started working on an ML based
project which I'm only able to approach or even think about pursuing is due to
Andrew Ng's cogent teaching. This
course has set my desultory mind in a certain path and made me rethink about
what I'm capable of doing.",5
959,"Thank a lot Andrew, I've see that you teach us with passion and try to give it to us. For me it's works. Courses are professional, useful and interpretable for anyone who make effort to learn Machine Learning. Merge with Data Science + Big Data specialization, hope the all it's give me a well ad to find a job.",5
960,"I really enjoyed this course! The lectures we well organized, and provided enough detail to get started, without overwhelming anyone without a CS/Statistics background. ",5
961,"All over the course, the effort put into making Machine Learning's technical details understandable by (almost) everyone is absolutely notable. Professor Ng explains with very remarkable clarity; his pleasant attitude greatly helped me follow the lessons and complete the tests on schedule. Also, the choice of coding in Matlab is key to enabling you to focus on the Maching Learning algorithms, while avoiding to lose time debugging other lower level programming languages. The course is fairly introductory and obviously the math has been kept as basic as possible, so I would strongly suggest this course as a first approach to the subject.",5
962,"The course if perfectly organized. It has just the right amount of complexity and forces you to think and understand what it is going on. Being proficient with Linear Algebra is a big plus, in particular with matrix operations. If you are not, not a bid deal, but I recommend spending a good amount of time on the review lessons. Trust me.",5
963,"I'm very new to ML. Even after completing the micro courses on Kaggle, I felt a void. Knowing how to use complex libraries wasn't enough. I felt that I needed more fundamental, theoretical knowledge in the field. I needed knowledge that I could rely on to make decisions when working on a ML problem. Prof. Ng filled that void with all the knowledge I have gained in this course. Completing this course gives me a new confidence to go use my new knowledge and tackle new ML  problems. I'm ever grateful for this! On the flip side, this course is long overdue for an update and I'd loved to have more thorough programming exercises. Thank you! ",5
964,"I had to build a ML pipeline (with deep learning) during my studies as a part of my master's thesis. I took this course to formalize what I had learned during that time. Now that I have seen the content, I truly wish I would have been aware of many of the concepts. It would have saved me a lot of time, effort, and stress. The programming exercises provided, were a very good way to cement the theoretical aspects from the lectures. That is only about the content. What is also worth mentioning is how good the lectures themselves are. The lecturer does a great job at presenting, which kept me attentive. Really, this is an awesome course!",5
965,"It is quite useful, the content taught in the video are clear and easy to understand. For the assignment, it has very detailed document to guide you how to do the practical assignment step by step. After finishing these courses, you will have a clear understand of the ML and familiar with the algorithms used for different situation to solve different problems, you will also learn how to adjust them to get the best performance and accurate results with minimum effort. One thing needed to mention is that after the course, do remember to build something by using what you learnt from the course to reinforce your understanding about them.",5
966,"That was worth the time spent on it! I feel lucky and grateful to Andrew Ng, actually, to have been able to follow such a quality course in Machine Learning. It totally demystified the way I was feeling about Artificial Intelligence, and made learning it a realistic objective for me. Quizzes and reviews often make you double-think about a tricky point that you will encounter in a subsequent problem. The labs are funny and interesting to implement, and Octave also really fun to learn by the way. Lots of real-life projects tricks. Tremendous value for the price. Now I'm looking forward to discover the other courses on deeplearning.ai.",5
967,I have attended 1-2 other course on other platforms but found them either pedantic or superfluous. But with this course I found the right balance. Pointers were given to the theoretical parts not explicitly covered in the course --- I went back to textbooks/journal articles to read-up on some of them. I also want to commend Andrew for his communication skills. ,5
968,"I have found this course very satisfying, and also it provided nice challenges in the programing excercises. Professor Ng is very focused on the practical results and the real life application of the concepts, which I found very straight forward and efficient. It was my first (professional and serious) online course and I am very happy with the final results as I feel confident for proceeding and applying the techniques in my professional life. Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng for such dedication. I have dedicated some time to volunteer in translating the course to Brazilian Portugueese as a form of retribution for such a nice course.",5
969,"This is probably the best Machine leaning course available online. Prof. Andrew Ng teaches every topics in very detail and easy to understand manner, even the most complex Machine learning concepts. Prof. Andrew Ng goes in great details deriving each and every mathematics/statistical formulae and explaining every topic with practical examples to correlate in real world. Quiz and test really test learner's deep understanding of subject and programming assignments are just excellent, covering complete concept of the Machine Leaning concepts we learn. Highly recommended to anyone who want to learn Machine Learning in its completeness.",5
970,"I thought this was an excellent, very accessible introduction to modern machine learning techniques. I would place it at a second-year undergraduate level. ",5
971,"This was my first class on Coursera and I couldn't have been more happier about it. Content is very well presented, mathematics standing behind various ML models is served to the listener with just enough details to understand it, but not to add any confusion. Assignments are great and really help you to understand how algorithms works.",5
972,"This is a great course to dive into ML/AI world. Teaching methodology is on point. With  good technical depth, a good quantum of emphasis is given to the application and intuition development(which is generally missing from most courses). Programming exercises are well planted to cement the concepts in the lectures. Free online matlab license which comes with taking this course is great incentive. I would recommend merking ""advanced linear algebra"" as a prerequisite to this course and professor overpass few key concepts. Adding a Final Project will also help. But overall this is a great course and i would recommend it to everyone!   ",5
973,Necessary and solid foundation for further work in machine learning.,5
974,"Was an amazing course for me, all lessons were really well explained by the professor, even if english is not my native language, course explanations were really nice to follow, great opportunity to learn from a really well prepared professor even for people like me which is not living in the U.S., I definitely recommend the course for all the people interested in learn about Machine learning, now I have completed the course I'm interested in see what's the next step. I like a lot the real examples used during the course, and the programming exercises which completes the theory side. Thanks a lot for this kind of opportunities :) ",5
975,"This is undoubtedly the best online course I've ever taken. I have learnt so much thanks to Andrew. his explanations were extremely clear, with lots of practical details and applicable real-life machine learning tricks. I started this course as a compliment to my Double MSc studies at UPC Barcelona, during the semester when I was taking the ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" subject. They recommended this course, and it was the best advise they could've given me. I'm so very grateful for all I've learnt and I am sure I'll soon be able to apply all this knowledge in my career and hopefully improve someone's life someday :)",5
976,"I chose this course after seeing other videos on the topic by Andrew Ng. I could tell that he had a passion for the subject that would carry over to anything he did with it. Including teaching it and setting up a respective course. I thus assumed the quality of this course would be high. And I was proved right. There were indeed times when I felt some things could have been written in a manner more aligned with how I would comprehend - especially when doing the tests and assignments - but that happens with all education. Simply because of the quality of delivery and how much I have learned, I am happy to give this course 5 stars. ",5
977,"Great introduction to machine learning. Course has both breadth (in terms of the different ML algorithms covered) and depth (detailed description and theory,  focus on implementation aspects, pointers to how to find the algorithmic fit for an application, how to tune an algorithm to improve performance and  overview of popular applications of ML). The quizzes are not straight forward and really test your understanding of the subject. Each lesson also has programming exercises  that help you understand the implementation aspects of ML. I would really recommend this course to anyone unfamiliar with ML and interested in learning it.",5
978,"Eu agradeço especialmente ao instrutor, a universidade e ao coursera por disponibilizar tanto o curso quanto o auxílio financeiro.",5
979,A fantastic machine learning course that helped me get a good grasp of various supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithm. ,5
980,"Excellent course.  Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Even better, he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and  performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques.  The main drawback about this material, for me, is that machine learning has evolved since this course's inception.  While these are excellent foundations, I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material, especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks.  This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start.",5
981,This course provides a very structured introduction to the subject of Machine Learning. ,5
982,"This was an excellent introductory course in ML. The videos were very informative (esp for someone not from the IT/Computing field) and Dr. Ng broke down all the concepts very well. The assignment  documents, starter codes, mentors/moderators were extremely helpful for completing the course assignments. Overall, I am very satisfied with the course. While I am not expert in ML by any stretch, the course allowed me to recognize how much more there is to know & learn in the field of ML! So, a big thank you to Dr. Ng for putting together this course and for the volunteer army of mentors who make quality learning accessible for all! ",5
983,This course is an excellent introduction to the field of Machine Learning. Professor Ng explains concepts in a way that a person without a background in maths may be able to understand them. The course balances between theoretical and practical aspects of the topic nicely although a little more weightage is given to the practical side. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested to get started with machine learning. The course may be not very useful for someone who has taken an undergraduate class in machine learning or statistical learning but I would still suggest you go through it to gain a lot of practical insights.,5
984,"I am satisfied with this course, it is a good introduction to ML. I have a background in numerical methods for solution of differential equations and optimization and data fitting, and I would like if there was an advanced version of this course with more in-depth theory and advanced exercises. I think, that having a certificate from completing an advanced ML course as a follow up for this course, may have more impact when using certificates for job search - because so many have earned a certificate from this course already.",5
985,I'be started this class when I worked for my bachelor thesis and I found it very inspiring and very useful in order to understand the machine learning analysis. Fortunately during my thesis I had some people which helped me in the analysis but this course has demonstrated fundamental in order to understand some of the principles that may be I didn't understand very well. I don't know if I will use machine learning a lot in my future but even if I use it a little I'm very pleased of having followed this class and I would like to say a huge thank you to the teacher which was always very clear in its explanation. Thank you a lot,5
986,Thank you very much Andrew NG sir,5
987,"This was a great course - thanks to Andrew Ng and the whole team! Without being a programmer or having machine learning background, I was concerned that I may not be able to keep up. The intuition building sections that Professor Ng has included throughout the course were very helpful in this regard, as they provide a lot of context. I highly recommend going through all the programming assignments, as they help solidify the knowledge from the respective week. There are many resources in the forums - the tutorials and the test cases were invaluable. I feel I have a solid grasp of the major machine learning concepts. Thank you!",5
988,I liked this course very much: ,5
989,This course is not a good to have but a must have for anybody looking to enter the field of machine learning. ,5
990,Eine sehr gute und umfangreiche Ausbildung im Bereich Machine Learning. ,5
991,"Machine learning has become an essential topic for building modern computer projects and systems. I was starting to lag behind my classmates who could at best projects at my college. Thankfully, I found this course and now understand and implement basic machine learning algorithms effectively. In this course the assignments are done in Octave/Matlab, ab bit different from now popular Python. But its not a big issue as just need to change syntax a bit and familiarize yourself with Python libraries. Everything else remains the same. I really want to thank the instructors and coursera for providing us with such wonderful course",5
992,"It's a fantastic course. I was able to learn a lot faster than in Uni. It's beautifuly structured by having videos under 20min - just about my concentration span. The quizzes in between are a great repetition of the knowledge. Andrew Ng is a perfect teacher, knowing which amount of math is necessary to properly understand the implications of the algorithms and knowing when to skip a complicated mathematical proof which most could not remember anyway. The programming assignments where first pretty hard for me - never having worked with MatLab. However, in the end they where almost too easy - another sweet spot Andrew Ng hit.",5
993,"This is a great class, all around. It gives you deeper insight into data characterization, evaluating cost functions, and determining performance measures ideally suit a particular problem or goal. The discussions and ""tips"" were very helpful. The ""intuition"" lectures were particularly valuable because it drove home the principles by adding context. This instructor is clearly dedicated to helping people understand principles behind machine learning for a variety of purposes, and I recommend it to any colleague who wants to refine their problem-solving skills, regardless of whether they have any interest in machine learning.",5
994,"Best course I've ever taken. I am a 4th year computer science major at UCSD and I was beginning to think that I suck at coding and can't learn anything useful. None of my classes at UCSD taught me anything and I was beginning to spite computer science due to my inability to understand it. However, Andrew Ng's instruction is so clear and informative, that even someone like me could understand him clearly. He gave me confidence in my abilities that I haven't had ever since attending college. Now I am working on my own personal machine learning projects which I would never have learned how to do if it were not for this course.",5
995,"It's a very integral (complete) course. It motivates you and catch you very soon with its real applications and good/amazing programming exercises. From my point of view It preserves equilibrium between being simple and direct but without losing math and programming formalism. I mean is not difficult to follow (you don't need to be an expert on calculus, linear algebra or programming to catch it up) but also if you're the kind of person interested in theory and math formalism it's also quite complete. It am willing to start my own application and applying some of the ML techniques Andrew shared us in this course. Thank you!",5
996,"I cant even begin to describe how much this course has done for me. I found this course after hours of scouring the internet for the best online tools for learning data science, programming and machine learning. Professor Ng's course has both validated and reinforced my passion for data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. It has not only inspired within me a deeper passion for machine learning but has given me the tools I need to realize this passion and continue pursuing intellectual and professional goals. Thank you, Professor Ng, for making such a world-class education free and accessible to everyone. ",5
997,"Very interesting and enriching course. At first, I was not sure if I liked the idea of working machine learning topics in Octave/Matlab, but now having completed the whole course I think that it was very convenient. I had been part of some others online courses on Machine Learning, specifically in Python, there I understand the main ideas of the problem, but I could not figured out what was the functions doing in the inside, there were like black boxes to me, whereas in this course I was able to grasp the math behind each topic and get to see the code implementation of each algorithm which I could understand. Great course.",5
998,This course was the best course i have ever seen on the Machine Learning Field.It is explained in so simplified way that anybody naive for the field can understand the intuition behind so easily.The core mathematical concepts which lead to the development and rise of Machine learning and which are so natural and therefore easy to understand are explained first and then they are expanded so that we learn the whole thing from its base to the real-world usage.I would really like to thank Andrew Ng for creating the course and teaching so keenly so that everybody can understand and become more passionate about the field.Thanks!,5
999,"This is a very helpful machine learning course for absolute beginners, basically you learn from ABC. You don't have to worry much about the linear algebra backgrounds because the professor will tell you what to know and what is advanced(optional), so you can choose to skip or learn, based on your level. I felt a sharp stop when finishing this course, because I know there are more complex principles behind it to discover, this is not included in this course, which may be a advantage for absolute beginners. All in all, I highly recommended this course to all of you who are still hesitating whether join in this course or not.",5
1000,I have an advanced degree in Electrical Engineering and I am currently a product manager sometimes working with very large amounts of sales data.  This course did an amazing job walking through the concepts of how to process that data and arrive at useful and actionable conclusions.  I have already used K-means clustering as a tool to help me in evaluating the next product to develop.  The course material requires a solid background in linear algebra and vector calculus would also definitely help in understanding the material.  I am definitely interested in this topic and plan to pursue it further.  This is a great class.,5
1001,"It was long course but very well prepared and presented by Professor Andrew NG. Most applications and insights are very enjoyable even if taken after so many years. Special mention to the mentors and guides who put tips to help achieve best results for assignments. The last but one week - week 10 was a little bit rushed, esply with topics like online learning which could have done with more elaboration and examples. Overall a tough course which i feel happy having completed with grades of 95% pass ! thank you professor Andrew NG and support team. Now i am eagerly checking out areas where i want to apply these concepts. :)",5
1002,"This is one of the best MOOC courses I have taken. Prof. Ng is amazing in my view. He is a perfect instructor for a MOOC because he teaching at many levels simultaneously. I know much more (or have refreshed my mind with) linear algebra in this course which was a total and unexpected side-effect for me. The mechanics of using machine learning (parts covered in this course) were I think enough so that I can actually ""get busy"". But best of all, Prof. Ng takes time and care in help us (students) develop intuitions for *why* you want to go at X in a certain way. I have throughly enjoyed just about all aspects of this course. ",5
1003,"This is the most awesome course that I have learned about Machine Learning. Dr. Ng explained each concepts in details and in clear ways. After taking this course, I understand those fundamental concepts and techniques of machine learning. Moreover, Dr. Ng provided us lots of useful Matlab codes to show how to implement machine learning to real examples. Most importantly, Dr. Ng shared very useful tips to improve learning performance and results. These tips come from rich industry experience and are hardly to learn from other courses. High appreciated for this course. Looking forward to learn from from Dr. Ng and Coursera.",5
1004,"Professor Ng has done a great job on this course, and the supporting resources (including the discussion forum posts from the course mentors) filled in any gaps I encountered.  This was a much gentler introduction to machine learning than some of the other tutorials and books I've tried, yet it was still thorough.  I gained a solid foundation from which I will have a much easier time understanding more advanced resources.",5
1005,"Fantastic introduction to Machine Learning.  Professor Ng's lectures were engaging and approachable; the programming assignments and quizzes mostly helped with deepening the understanding of the material; and the course provided a great high-level survey of current machine learning algorithms, techniques, and real-world advice and experiences in applying machine learning to characteristic problems.  I would highly recommend this course to any CS student, current practitioner that would like a gentle introduction to an important field of CS, or even a strong high-school senior with a reasonable grounding in linear algebra.",5
1006,"This course is high quality stuff! As an introduction to machine learning it is perfect. It covers many of the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning and presents information cleanly and accessibly. Professor Ng also goes through the trouble of presenting the more advanced concepts for those of us who are familiar with more advanced math in separate optional videos. The workload is reasonable and can easily be managed with a full time job. All the assignments were very well structured, interesting and showcased real world applications. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning about machine learning. ",5
1007,"This was a great introduction to machine learning.  It had a great balance between theory and working on problems.  The number of topics, that needed to be covered, was somewhat overwhelming.    I think I would gain a more complete understanding of machine learning by going through the course a second time.  By knowing where I will be going, a second pass would provide more continuity  to the material.",5
1008,"Its an Amazing course, covers from basics for newbies to core ML concept for hands on ML engineers. small but important aspects like ceiling analysis, diagnostic tools are explained with practical examples. This course beautifully connects all the models/techniques used in ML. It starts with fundamentals but not too much into theoretical concept. Very good balance of proofs and practical applications. I would like to recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn ML or who is getting started or haven't yet done this course.  Its mix of Linear Algebra+ optimization theory + algorithms + Analytics. Thanks Andrew Ng!!",5
1009,Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning. Dr. Andrew Ng does an excellent job covering the fundamentals of various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms as well as their practical applications. He also covers error analysis and provides programming assignments. ,5
1010,"This was a great class!!! Instruction was cool, calm, and easy to follow - even when the material gets a bit dense. Real world examples, top notch instruction, and accompanying programming assignments that put the skills to use in a higher level programming environment means I had to spend only a comparatively small amount of time learning the syntax to get my solutions to work correctly. Compared to other classes taught in R or Python, you spend a lot less time having to learn to program (or worse, having to code a certain way because a kludgy grader) and a lot more time learning and applying machine learning concepts. ",5
1011,I really enjoyed the course particularly because I have an engineering back ground with 20 years of analysis experience and an aptitude for data analysis. This has given me a great introduction and insight to most day to day machine learning functions in applications and wondered how did they do it. I must say Prof. Ng is a great teacher and his passion runs through the course material and down to earth. His ability to understand the student's state of mind while teaching complicated functions and providing comforting words to encourage next steps are specials of this course adding human teaching to learning experience.,5
1012,"I'm an electronics Engineering undergraduate  student and I had never known anything about ML before entering this class. In this course, the explanation of  those complex ML concept is very clearly, and the examples used in the course help me understand those concept a lot. Moreover, this course also offer me the opportunity to implement ML algorithm. And I'm really curious how the submit system works :) ",5
1013,"I really enjoyed the course. Prof. Ng is very motivating, he helps the student focus on the essential. Having stumbled on other courses on the coding part of the course, I really appreciated in that course that the coding is minimal and only to check that you understand the maths and get comfortable manipulating matrices. Octave language is really easy to grasp. Overall very happy, the course gave me that wide overview of machine learning and is a great start for me to now focus on more specific aspects of machine learning such as deep learning, RNN, reinforcement learning, etc. Thanks to Prof Ng and the coursera team!",5
1014,"A very well structured course for understanding machine learning and the algorithms that drive most common ML techniques. Prof. Andrew is phenomenal in explaining the mathematical concepts in a lucid and easy way. The coverage of topics such as evaluating the learning model, error analysis, tuning the algorithms, ceiling analysis etc. is of great help to understand the practical design aspects of implementing a ML model.",5
1015,"It was for me the first exprience of taking a class online - and  Prof. Andrew Ng set high standards. Not by providing ""super cool"" animations and using best-in-class visualizations, but with sticking to what is really important: understanding and teaching the mechanics behind machine learning as well as the math involved in it. This is what sparks the joy of learning new things - to get teached by someone who shares the same joy of sharing his/her knowledge. The hard work involved in setting up this class as well as the coursera platform is well acknowledged. Wish the entire team all the best for the future.",5
1016,I loved the content. I admire Andrew Ng teaching skills. He actually build a very impressive interest into Machine Learning and provided great ideas. I liked to share some of my recommendations as below: ,5
1017,"This is undoubtedly a well taught course. Every week is a new topic, well structured in its flow to exposure to these new topics, with in depth coverage. This took me from knowing practically no ML techniques to having a repertoire that I am confident in with new side project idea.",5
1018,"This course was so effective in introducing me to machine learning and giving me extremely practical experience implementing the algorithms. I really appreciated the programming assignments; very tangible and direct way to learn. Completing them has given me confidence in using these skills and a code reference I can turn back to in the future. I truly appreciate the teaching of Andrew Ng, I have taken many CS classes at UC Berkeley and found this to give just as fantastic instruction as a full semester in person course. Im honestly shocked at how learning can be so much easier through this online format. Thanks again!",5
1019,"This is the first course that I have completed via Coursera. The videos/presentation were easy to follow (I liked the function to view the videos at 1.5 x)  and there was a lot of guidance as to how to proceed with the programming assignments. Programming is not one of my strong skills, but if you follow the tutorials that the mentors have set up and use the test cases, it was  very doable. I do think that students need to search for similar questions in the forums more. I found that so many people ask the same questions that have already been asked and answered before. The mentors have been very patient with everyone.",5
1020,"Great overall experience. The lectures are top notch. The section on backward propagation in neural nets was particularly well done. You spend most of the homeworks getting Octave implementations to work based on provided scaffolding  code. This is a good method, but it does mean that you spend time with few examples than you might expect, as you must write the implementations at a fairly low level. The upside is that you end up with a deeper understanding of the methods than you might get from, say, using high-level commands in R.",5
1021,"Absolutely brilliant course; I must admit I was sceptical of doing the programming exercises in Octave - but I feel like it was the right choice to focus on substance rather than technicalities and would recommend this course to anyone, even if you have reservations about the choice of language. ",5
1022,  Overall the course is great and the instructor is awesome.  ,5
1023,"The balance between learning and practice is good, though the coding part is a bit too easy, i.e. much of the work is done for you. I strongly suggest playing with the different pieces of code, or try to rewrite a function without looking at the provided code (at least at first). Finally, each video is short enough to fit between two tasks or when you are waiting for something/someone at work. I very much enjoyed learning to do ML, especially since this is my first class on the subject. I already put to good use what I learned and will probably write a paper on the discoveries I made. Thank you Andrew Ng and Coursera!",5
1024,"This was my first introduction to Machine Learning, a topic I previously thought of as impossibly complicated. This course has been incredibly insightful (and as concise as possible). The organisation and pace of the course made it easy to follow (and you can simply pause whenever needed). The programming coursework had most of the ""padding code"" already provided, letting the student focus on the machine learning core of the assignment.",5
1025,"I have worked on macroeconomic forecasting and credit risk modelling for over 7 years. I have also studied statistics, mathematics and econometrics in University quite intensively. I am grateful to Andrew Ng for this amazing class, which I finished only recently. It really deepened my knowledge on topics I considered simple, like linear models and introduced me to interesting concepts and drew my attention to important details that I believe will help me be a better professional in the field of data science. I strongly recommend the course and the programming assignments to all beginners and experienced people alike.",5
1026,"This was an excellent course. For the first time I realized the importance and usefulness of all these mathematical concepts like vectors, matrices, calculus and algebra for resolving the real life problems. This course helped me generating a lot of interest towards Machine learning and kept me going even when it was a little difficult to grasp it fully. Thanks to Andrew Ng and Coursera for putting this excellent course together for us, and making it so easy to go through, and for putting that extra efforts to help with not just understanding these concepts better but also towards the effective application of these.",5
1027,"A fantastic introduction to machine learning. This should be the default starting point  for anyone who wishes to enter this domain. I regret taking advanced machine learning courses without doing this one first. The fact that the whole course is taught using Matlab means learners write code at a more fundamental level as opposed to merely importing Python libraries. The assignments were well designed although I wish some of them had a smaller amount of starter code. A final project would have been a welcome addition as well. Overall though, it truly has been a great learning experience. Strongly recommended course!",5
1028,"This course was a stretch, and it definitely took me out of my comfort zone. As a marketer and an analyst, I did not take this course to pivot into another field, but rather to equip myself with a working knowledge of technologies that are currently reshaping the way we live and do business. It took me a lot longer than 11 weeks to complete this course, as there were many times where I had to re-watch the videos. Andrew Ng is a stellar professor and an innovative human being. I am really glad I went through with this course, there were times where it seemed impossible, but I got through and I feel a lot smarter now.",5
1029,"This is by far the most significant and eye-opening courses that can happen to any ""modern mainstream software engineer"". It showed(actually reminded) me that an academic course can be very practical and real-life oriented.  ",5
1030,"Antes del curso no tenia ningún conocimiento sobre el aprendizaje de maquinas, se que después de haber tomado las clases aun me falta mucho por aprender, pero quiero decir que estoy muy agradecido por tener abierta la posibilidad de tener una enseñanza libre y de fácil acceso a todas las mentes hambrientas de conocimiento y en la conquista de nuevas fronteras científicas y educativas.",5
1031," I learned about this course from Professor Andrew Ng a long time ago, but only now have I had the opportunity to do it and go through with it. It took 2 months and 4 days of learning, each week one more step in this journey of learning in Machine Learning. Now, after the end, the plug goes down and we kind of really understand how this area has impacted, impacts and certainly will change the future, it's just incredible. And the most incredible thing of all is to be able to access this knowledge even more the way Professor Andrew went. Excellent course, I recommend it to everyone who has an interest in the area! <3  ",5
1032,PROS:  Great videos and notes; very helpful quizzes that encouraged paying attention to each video.  End of chapter quizzes and programming assignments were sufficiently challenging and rewarding.  Mentors were awesome; very helpful and accessible (this is HUGE). ,5
1033,,5
1034,Awesome Course for anyone who has just begin his/her ML journey!,5
1035,I have taken the following courses:,5
1036,"It's really not a easy work to finish all of videos and programming exercise. And through this class, I really get a lot of practical skills like Advanced optimization algorithms, Error Analysis et cetera, that are very useful and I've never heard before. ",5
1037,"This has been a great course with a nice learning curve for me. I was trying to use Machine Learning in my current work and this course helped me get my hands dirty and understand the internals and concepts behind, although i had to refresh my linear algebra and calculus a bit :). Thank you Professor Andrew Ng for making the lessons easy to understand and having the motivation intact with simple examples.  With these tools and knowledge that i have gained, I am better equipped to work on different problem areas and apply concepts of Machine Learning in a effective way. Thank you Prof. Andrew and the coursera team.",5
1038,"Amazing course giving a profound yet easy to understand insight in the world of Machine Learning. Dr Ng is able to explain very complex concepts in a simple manner where anyone with even basic math knowledge can learn and implement their own ML algorithms. Overall it encourages you to keep digging for more knowledge related to ML, and it gives you the necessary tools to understand it on your own. The practical assignments are very good and made simple with understandable MATLAB/Octave code not only to put your ML knowledge in practise but also as a general tutorial for this software. I fully recommend this course.",5
1039,"I must say this is the best course I ever attended. The reason for this is  entirely Prof. Andrew Ng. His style of teaching by introducing  ML concepts through examples, refining our understanding  through quizzes and finally make us learn ML algorithms through a series of interesting assignments is marvelous.  I am sure I learnt ML from him, but I must say  additionally I actually learnt how to be a good teacher. Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng for your valuable offering.  I eagerly look forward for learning more from you and, work with you if I ever get an opportunity in future. ",5
1040,"Excellent course with very valuable information to ahve good basis. 1. Questions are sometimes placed just before the subject is exposed; would be better to put it after. 2. I think the focus on the programming exercises should be towards vectorized solutions. Multiples FOR iterations make more difficult to grasp the concept and instead makes the person to lost focus. 3. Discussion forums are OK and provide valauble input to make people not to get stuck in details, but sometimes it makes task too easy (recipe following). 4. Some videos become soemtimesa repetitive. 5. Option to save teacher's notes is excellent.     ",5
1041,"This course has been really informative and amazing. Professor Andrew Ng is an amazing and dedicated teacher who makes sure to teach and explain every aspect of Machine Learning,. He also makes sure to talk about his opinions and the methodologies used in today's industries, which in my opinion is insightful. It was an amazing experience to be a student under his guidance! I recommend you to take this course if you are a beginner like me or want to learn the details of the foundation of Machine Learning. Thank you so much Professor Andrew Ng and Coursera team for giving me this opportunity to learn! Best wishes.",5
1042,"Amazing introductory course in Machine Learning. Dr. Ng is knowledgeable,  clear, and inspirational. ",5
1043,I learnt a lot and really enjoyed the course. A lot has been said about this course and I agree completely with all the stellar reviews that this course has earned on Coursera and elsewhere.,5
1044,"I've been enrolled in many many many online courses before, and I honestly never finished any of them. Every time I register, I watch the first week, maybe the first two weeks, and then I dump it. This course is the first course that I actually finish. I worked so hard, and it took me so much time, but trust me, everything is worth this course. Everything here makes the course more helpful and amazing. Also, seeing all the people in the threads from every country and from different backgrounds, having the same passion or spending their times with you on this course is absolutely amazing. I totally recommend it. ",5
1045,"Fantastic introduction to machine learning. It covers a lot of different topics and professor Andrew Ng does an exceptional job of explaining very complicated concepts in a fairly simple way. He also gives a lot of valuable advice from his years of experience building different machine learning systems. Furthermore, it includes a lot of programming assignments which are done in Octave/Matlab that help students gain better understanding of topics covered during lessons. Thank you to Andrew Ng, Stanford University and Coursera for this incredible course! Highly recommend to anyone interested in machine learning. ",5
1046,"One of the Top Courses in Machine Learning and Prof. Andrew NG has really put lot of hard work into creating such wonderful course content, review questions, lecture notes and quizzed and programming exercises. ",5
1047,"It was a fascinating course, lots of interesting ideas and practices that I hope to implement in the near future. Sometimes the lectures felt like they dragged on a little bit on the certain subjects and some of the assignments seem to have very small concept to implement. I appreciate that it's difficult to make really good assignment questions though. I really appreciated the ability to take the course for mastery and repeat assignment submissions and quiz submissions until you had everything perfect. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning or implementing any kind of machine learning.",5
1048,"This course is a
very approachable introduction to machine learning which gives you
tools you can immediately use in practical applications. You should
know the basics of linear algebra (matrix multiplication, transposes,
dot products, etc...) and what derivatives are, but you won't
actually be required to do something like differentiate a function.
In this sense the course isn't very mathematically rigorous, but
perhaps this is the best route for an introductory level course.
Check out Stanford’s official version of this course (CS 229) for a
more complete approach. The slides and videos are available freely.",5
1049,"Professors Andrew Ng and Tom Mosher brilliantly sum up the basics of machine learning in this very clear and well planned course.  Dr. Ng provides the needed mathematics and motivation to the many applications of machine language without all of the complications of the underlying derivations.  Dr. Mosher provides tutorials, test cases, and assistance promptly when needed.  For those who have a basic level of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, and Logic, I would highly recommend this course.  Thank you to all of the Mentors and Professors who took their time to provide for this course!  You are truly heroes!",5
1050,An amazing course by a brilliant teacher!! The course material was perfect for a beginner with a reasonable amount of technical knowledge but not so deep and in-depth so as to not being able to understand anything.  ,5
1051,"I’m grateful for having  learned machine learning from the Stanford University online platform which is provided by Coursera.org. I benefited tremendously from the the videos of professor Ng, the tutorials and test cases provided by the mentors, and the wonderfully written curriculum and programming assignments.  Compared to before taking this course, I am much more captivated about data science and am more confident as I set out the long journey of learning and doing machine learning.  On the programming front, it was my first exposure to Matlab but I fell in love with  doing numerical computing with Matlab. ",5
1052,In depth view of machine learning with a profound mathematical background. Good balance between the important algebra and the less important (need to know the formulas) version. Programming challenges were good as the data is represented in a different format as the course so you need to think thru the representation and the correct implementation.,5
1053,"Hi,",5
1054,"I have studied statistics, and advanced mathematics 10 years ago, but oddly enough never really put it in practice. This class helped me a lot to reconnect to this forgotten knowledge, and for the first time in ages, to actually pull up my sleeves and code myself. I never used Matlab before but it was surprisingly convenient and I enjoyed every hour spent on the course or debugging my code. ",5
1055,"Très belle introduction au machine learning ! Seule critique : les exercices de programmation sont un peu trop ""guidés"" mais en même temps il ne s'agit que d'une introduction ... ",5
1056,Overall an excellent course. Doing this course really provided me with good intuition behind a lot of the machine learning algorithms as well as solid practice in implementing components of them. As someone who recently completed a masters degree in Data Science there were still many concepts unclear to me which I felt were covered really well by this course. The course did include a fair amount of linear algebra so it definitely helped having experience in that but I felt like the analogies and simple explanations were still great for understanding the algorithms even if you don't come from that background.,5
1057,"This is a very informing class and told me the basic things of machine learning. Author Andrew Ng obviously has a lots of real project, I learned not just from theoretic aspect of machine learning, but also from a machine learning problem to solve real world problem. After the course, i learned the real issue with machine learning is still an state of the art process, it requires a lots of knowledge and experience. One realization is that machine learning is about utilizing, using, inferring with large set of data. One should be getting very good at playing with large data. That is basis of machine learning. ",5
1058,Andrew Ng is a skilled instructor who is adept at covering the material in a manner which makes it digestible to folks who may even have been a few years removed from their last university level Algebra and math courses and who have not been directly programming for quite some time.  While I had been working on telemetry and big data analytics it was from a business perspective with a decent amount of common sense understanding about what was underneath making it work.  I now feel like a have a good amount of depth into the details of the techniques and application of the high level concepts.  Thanks Andrew!,5
1059,"I watched the videos elsewhere as the dual-language subtitles are offered there, but I finished the test and programming task here. Thank Prof. Ng for offering such a impressive start-up course for me, who wanted to learn this skill for a long time. I know I'm far from an 'expert' (professor likes encouraging), but I will keep on advancing forward, such as deep learning. Again, thank you very much, professor.",5
1060,"This course is excellent and it is really worth the time and hard work during eleven weeks. Also, it requires some math background specially derivate calculus to better understand the concepts behind the algorithms. After the course you will have a solid foundation regarding Machine Learning and will allow you to pursuit some more advanced subjects like deep learning, for example. Finally, professor Andrew Ng is great, he explains this subject extremely well, shares a lot of useful advices, tips and insights that will make your learning experience to be as best as possible. Definitely recommend this course.",5
1061,"Professor Ng's course was one of the best online courses I've ever taken. Ng explains all of the material in a very clear, straightforward, and down-to-earth way, and he makes his knowledge accessible to students from any background. He gives plenty of resources for linear algebra and multivariable calculus experts to get a really deep understanding of the underlying algorithms, while also summing up the gist of each lesson for people who may not have the technical background to go so deeply into the theory. Overall, 10/10 and would highly recommend for anybody trying to enter the world of machine learning.",5
1062,"super course, I have 20 years experience with programming language and also know the mathematics rules. I know how time expensive it is to try out some ideas. So I am very happy with the recommendation of  Octave to get a tool for a very quick try out mathematical ideas. If this tool will be the right one for Software-project work I am not sure, but I will see. Thank you very much for this course to Andrew Ng. I have no interest at certifcates but I will take the hole course very quick. ",5
1063,"This course was an amazing, memorable journey. I started off feeling slightly intimidated by the programming aspect since I am not from an Computer Science/Engineering or Math/Statistics background. To my surprise, however, the lectures really gave me a flavor of the ""bigger picture"" or the intuition behind each of the learning algorithms, and the programming exercises helped me apply the knowledge and really grow as a problem-solver.  I highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to become familiar with a cutting-edge, exciting field that is sure to become very much mainstream in the near future.  ",5
1064," Prof. Andrew Ng did a really excellent job in this course for understanding Machine Learning.  The assignments, as well as the choice on programming language ensures that the learners can focus on the concept itself instead and less on the nuances of syntax.  The lectures are well divided into sections interrupted by short quizzes that allows learners can self-check if they understood that particular segment before moving on to the next.  This lesson is perfect not just in teaching the subject matter itself, but also in demonstrating how the lesson can be presented in a way that it can easily be understood.",5
1065,"neural network concept was amazing and one of the attractive concept that how human learn (i.e as from birth of human they have blank mind/memory/skill).one thing we should think that about one of the major difference between machine and human is that after getting losing every thing (i.e hopes,  what to do?, where to do? and why to do?) some peoples are there who never got depressed and always try to perform there best effort in learning and  improving himself (i.e what should i do , where should i go, why i am here ?) until their life ends . will it be possible for machine also??? can we make possible???",5
1066,"I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in this course. Although it took a significant amount of time to work through, I feel that all of the work was well worth it. My understanding of the basics of machine learning now places me in a position far beyond that which I could have imagined being in. My thanks to the the author of the course, Andrew Ng for all of the work which he put into this course. It is appreciated by many. I am at the beginning of an academic career in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence and I have no doubt that the lessons from this course will guide me time and time again.",5
1067,I heartily recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning. Dr. Ng is a thorough and quite understandable instructor.  He starts at the beginning and doesn't leave out a ton of steps like many teachers do.  The classwork is challenging but very doable and right on target with what was covered that week.  I enjoyed the programming exercises. The quizzes inside the videos were helpful in making me think about what was just covered in different ways.  This was a very valuable course for me and I'll be using my notes and the class slides for my future work. Thank you for this course.,5
1068,"I express my sincere gratitude to Prof Andrew who has so aptly put forward the intricacies of the course. At the same time I am thankful to Tom Moshar, the mentor, who has the ability to skillfully guide when needed. The interesting aspect in his guidance are the subtle and intelligent hints, only that one has to catch them. I intend to engage myself in data science projects and for this purpose would like to explore different possibilities that may exist with your organization and also with others. As the situation may demand I'll not hesitate to attend more such meaningful courses in due course. Thanks.",5
1069,"This course was great. I learned a lot about machine learning. Prior to taking this course I was reading a book and as informative as the book was it was very difficult to follow and understand, but this course was very well structured and really good quizes and assignment that helped me put in practice what I was learning. Excellent professor. And the last thank you video recognizing the effort we as students put into this was also a great touch. I would also like to thank the professor for giving me this knowledge and hopefully I can use it to create something very fun and powerful. Thank you very much.",5
1070,"The instructor is patient and explain lots of concepts and algorithms very clearly and in details (sometimes  a little too much). The instructor tells how to perform an algorithm, but seldom explain why we can use that algorithm. I hope that he can open an advance course in machine learning to help me understand the theory behind each algorithm and provide more projects on machine learning. At last, I hope that the instructor can include a Photo OCR project at the end of this course.",5
1071,"I cannot recommend this course enough, it introduced me to machine learning and made me love it. ",5
1072,"The video
lectures by Andrew Ng are absolutely awesome. 
This goes both for the explanations and for the choice of topics.  The programming excercises are also meticulously
prepared and well thought through and so one can learn a lot from them.",5
1073,"The complicated algorithms were explained in a way that cannot be easier to make the learners be profound. Typical algorithms such as supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, support vector machine, PCS, Clustering, Anomaly Detection, and so on were taught and explained completely. Furthermore, many practical problems in the field also considered during the course assignment like logistic regression, anomaly detection, spam-email classification, image compression,.. to help the learner sharpen their skills of not only modeling practical problem into computer ones, but also the programming skills.",5
1074,Amazing course! Content is easy to follow.  Material that seems daunting on first inspection is dissected and presented in a very intuitive way.  The quizzes and especially the Octave/Matlab practice problems are extremely helpful to check your understanding.  The scripts are organized very clearly and provides insight on how all the modelling steps should be structured. Mentors for the course are exceptionally helpful.  I cannot think of a single criticism.  It is hard for me to imagine anyone who is interested in machine learning and is new to the subject walking away disappointed. Thank you Andrew Ng!,5
1075,"Great way to get introduced to machine learning. I particularly like the way Prof. Ng encourages learners especially where he suspects to have deep content touched (Read NN and the like!) The breadth and depth of the course, in my opinion is just right.. I feel that it gets learners (me) to get to understand machine learning and how it fits in the bigger data picture with a hint of.. ""hey, there is more to this stuff!""",5
1076,"Truly one of the best courses I have ever taken! Not only did I learn various concepts concerning the Machine Learning field, but I could strenghten them by knowledge-checking quizes and implementation assignments as well. Now I now what is happening ""under the hood"" :) A lot of relevant examples, clear explanations and, what is also quite valuable, introducing the concepts required to proceed, e.g. Octave basics, operations on matrices, etc. I strongly recommend this course to everyone who wants to start his/her adventure with Machine Learning or even to someone who already has some knowledge about it.",5
1077,"Thanks a lot Andrew, while sometimes I struggled to review some of the concepts I got what I wanted which was an intuition to the machine learning world, specially when trying to understand what has been done an what is the state of the art for machine learning. Not only knowing what machine learning is and how to approach it, I now understand the different algorithms available and how to use them, but beyond that this course gave me the information and tools to make an educated guess on what are the topics that I'll have to improve to get better at modeling different problems in this area of knowledge.",5
1078,"This is an excellent introductory course in machine learning. You will learn the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. You will learn about classification and regression machine learning algorithms. You will learn what types of problems to apply them to. You will learn what actually goes on behind the curtain of some of the more popular machine learning algorithms (i.e. linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, SVM). You'll also have fun doing programming assignments where you'll have the opportunity to implement handwriting recognition and email spam detection.  ",5
1079,"This course gives a fantastic overview of the major concepts in Machine Learning. For someone like me with no programming background, the pace of this course is also excellent. The course motivates you to start building your own ML algorithms and implores you to learn in greater detail the finer nuances of the concepts explained herewith. ",5
1080,"I thought this course was a great introduction to a lot of Machine Learning algorithms and concepts. The key thing for me is that a lot of the time is spent on explaining the intuition behind these concepts. You can always look up equations or algorithms later, but understanding how it works and why will have a much more lasting impact. I feel I have a better grasp on the bigger picture with this material. The assignments were also usually effective, spending the most time on the core parts of these algorithms, with enough code already implemented to avoid getting bogged down on less important details.",5
1081,"Absolutely amazing course. Machine Learning now makes sense, and I can begin to understand why ML applications work so well...and why they fail when they do. The programming exercises help a lot in understanding the video lectures. The only downside is that, due to the nature of the course, real numbers/answers and exact approaches to solving a problem cannot be discussed. This is a shame (since I learn more from how I made a mistake) but understandable. Despite having finished and passed the course, I plan to go through the discussion forums to see if I cannot glean some more information and insights.",5
1082,"I have been interested in Machine Learning for many years and found this to be a fantastic and holistic introduction to the field. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at university and found the caliber of this class to be on the same level, if not better than my formal university classes. I thoroughly appreciated the way in which Prof. Ng structured each of the topics and then provided further necessary detail. Lastly, the additional advice given throughout the course about the application of the algorithms and the design of ML systems is what makes this the complete package. Thanks very much Prof. Ng!",5
1083,"Highest ratio of the complexity of the matter to the complexity of its explanation. Great work! And there's side-effect: looking at how many equations evolved, it just allowed my neurons to take its comprehension to next layer, so to speak, ;-) so these are not just mere ""procedures"" to follow, that were used by the first of my ""layers"", but now there's also deeper and more abstract understanding of these concepts, what is characteristic for layers with higher index. ;-) Once again: GREAT STUFF and THANK YOU VERY MUCH, Mr ANDREW NG, for your time and gentle, yet insightful explanation of many concepts!",5
1084,"Thank you so much Andrew for this wonderful course! I really enjoyed the way you introduce different topics giving some intuition first and then getting into more details. Quizzes along the way are very instructive. The assignments are also extremely well designed and very instructive, the classification hand-written numbers problem, spam classifier and movie rating are my favorite! Overall the course gives a very nice picture of ML especially in terms of applications, as well as how applying learning algorithms in practice. I'm just eager starting another course in deep learning! ",5
1085,"This course is a good way to understand base of machine learning. If you have a base knowledge in linear algebra (vectorize operations) you will able to get the challenge :) Much more better way with this course - if you know about calculus and theory of probabillity, base of statistics. Ofcourse, you have to able to programming - but syntaxis Octave is very close to simple translation language of math to compute's language. Well, I would like to prefer Python then Octave, but (in general) I'm glad to knowing some new language (especially since I learned programming languages some pretty small time).",5
1086,"It is one of the courses I ever had. Professor is wonderful at teaching!. This course will definitely help you to increase your knowledge and understanding of machine learning. Important parts covered in the course are supervised learning - linear, logistic regression, neural network, SVM, Unsupervised learning: PCA, K-means clustering, anomaly detection, handing large scale machine learning, error analysis and ceiling analysis. I enjoyed this course a lot. I will try to apply whatever I learnt through the course in my life. I am very thankful to Professor Andrew Ng for such a nice course! Thank you. ",5
1087,"I highly recommend taking this course.  Years ago I was majoring mathematics in college.  In this course I found that due to the technology, many complex schemes can be implemented while in my college days, we only learned about the theories.  The actual implementation was too time consuming and out of question.  I am glad to see the advance of technology makes complex things possible.  As a side note, I end up liking Octave/Matlab a lot for its vectorization features or matrix operations.  I will continue taking more advanced ML courses and enjoying the journey to become more competent in this area.",5
1088,"I have done few online learning courses and I can tell you with confidence that this is by far one of the best out there and Andrew NG is a great teacher. The concepts are explained very clearly, at a decent pace, the use of pointer/marker materials to connect the audio to the screen contents was well done. The examples provided to the concepts and the learning exercises were good. And the support system for the assignments (tutorials, forums) were good too. Overall a very good one. The course introduces you to the basics of machine learning and it's then up to the learners to explore and learn more. ",5
1089,"This is an excellent course. Professor Ng selects topics carefully, so that the student learns very practical things with just the right amount of theory that is necessary. Of course, much more theory could be learned, but I think this is the optimal with respect to the learning time and effort that has to be spent for a machine learning beginner. Particularly the practical advice on how to build solid machine learning systems, how to debug them, etc. is in my view extremely valuable. Last but not least, I find that Professor Ng has a wonderful style of teaching, and the course is huge fun to follow.",5
1090,I like this course very much. ,5
1091,"Really great course. The lectures were instructive and detailed without wasting time. The quizes tested well that you understood the material, and the assignments made you learn not just how to do machine learning but how to do it well and intelligently. ",5
1092,"Cannot thank Professor Andrew Ng enough for the manner in which he delivered this course showing enormous patience from the beginning right till the end. The fact that he did not shirk from  dwelling on the little details made it that much easier for everyone to follow him closely so that the quizzes and the review questions, though challenging, could be cleared successfully with reasonable effort. This course I believe really sets me up for advanced courses in ML/AI and of course to confidently take up problems of the real world so that we can benefit from the practical impact of ML/AI.  Thank You",5
1093,"An excellent course. The most important topics about machine learning are covered with a good balance between theory and practice. After every lesson you really feel you've gained something ""usable"". You learn algorithms but, most of all, you are able to get confidence in the right way to use them. You don't get only the knowledge about machinery but also, and more important, about the ""process"" of building a learning system choosing the right tools and techniques.",5
1094,"My neurons are blessed to have learned about their simulated digital counterparts, under the well-planned, effective pedagogy of one of the most soft-spoken and kind instructors here, Sir Prof. Ng. The course has very intricately detailed, almost hand-picked topics that seem to miss no mark on offering the best advice for industrial application, alongside the astute technical know-how imparted. The topics are coherent, albeit, a pre-existing base of some linear algebra could be of even greater help. Loved learning it. Peculiar thing is, it'd be nostalgic for me now, having completed this course :)",5
1095,"Excellent course ! Helped me learn the fundamentals of ML. Some of the most important ML algorithms have been beautifully explained my Prof Andrew Ng. Thought provoking, and we need to learn (It is worth going through 3blue1brown linear algebra and neural network series in YouTube) and work offline to understand the concepts, leveraging the explanations provided by Prof.",5
1096,"An excellent course for beginners.My advice is learn a little bit about linear algebra,calculus (multivariable) probability and statistics.Even if you don't know these,you can progress with the course but knowing them will make this course more fun for you.This course touches on a lot of machine learning techniques and enlightens the students by giving them a gentle introduction to each topic rather than going into a very big depth.Of all the introductory courses available on the internet,I found this one to be the best .Prof Andrew Ng rocks!!!If you don't believe me check out the other reviews!!!",5
1097,"First contact with GNU Octave (not with programming) and I finished the course and the programming exercises so the course must be well designed. The lectures were punctual and student time was expended with efficiency. Just note the audio is a bit low quality at times, I'm not native of the language and I need the subtitles (in english, as the errors in translations to my natural language makes preferable to use the english subtitles so I can compensate for the times when I cannot understand the audio). Subtitles seems automated (pardon me if they aren't) but the accuracy for english is superior.",5
1098,"A wonderful course on the fascinating and wide field of Machine Learning, this class has been eye opening and has done a wonderful job at sparking a deeper interest in this vast, vast field. As Prof. Ng says in the last video, I hope to build something cool and useful for people with what I've picked up here.  The course has done a very good job at balancing the level of depth along with the number of topics. Barring a few topics in the end such as recommender systems which I feel was a topic too complex but had to be brushed through, I genuinely enjoyed every other one. Thank you for this course!",5
1099,Thanks so much!,5
1100,"I wish to thank Andrew for being THE BEST lecturer ever, so knowledgeable, patient and overall generous for sharing his impressive knowledge with the world. I had tried but failed to do this course for a number of years now. Last year I decided it was time to go beyond week 2 no matter what. It was really challenging but also rewarding to check my progress and to make sure I understood the concepts before applying them. I think it is Andrew's merit to have come up with the structure and mechanisms to make this course. Once again THANK YOU ANDREW, it means a lot to me to have finished this course.",5
1101,I'm very grateful that Mr. Andrew Ng gave this course for free. I'm at the beginning of my journey with data science. I've joined a bootcamp and this course helped me a lot as an additional cempletion of knowledge. Thanks to this course I knew what my tutors were talking to me :),5
1102,"This course is a great insight into Machine Learning and its applications to problems.  Andrew Ng's lectures do a great job of showing the applications of Machine Learning to problems and determining the correct method to apply.  Having had some previous experience with using Matlab it did not take too long to wrap my head around some of the assignments, but if someone were to approach this course with no experience whatsoever the material and the forum moderators make it much easier to learn.  I did this course simply out of curiosity and I am very happy with the knowledge that I got out of it.",5
1103,"This is a very well structured course on all the foundational concepts of Machine Learning algorithms and related topics.  It also elaborates on several useful tools and techniques to develop and evaluate complex Machine Learning systems. The quizzes have been well structured and programming assignments have not only been well designed but also well documented to instruct the students to smoothly go through the exercises and reinforce the concepts.  The tutorials, test cases and discussion forums are great assets as well.  Overall it is a great way to begin the journey in Machine Learning space.",5
1104,It was a great experience learning from Andrew Ng Sir! The course has taught me many things that was fun learning and knowing. Also the programming exercises are very interesting and helps to get new ideas and innovations about the ways we can implement a particular problem. This course has motivated me to dive deeper into the field of ML (which I have had confusion about which field to choose as a career which is challenging and more interesting) and gave me insights of the things I can do further using the contents I learned from this course. Thanking Andrew Ng Sir for such a wonderful course.,5
1105,"As a whole an excellent course on machine learning! Professor Ng is a great teacher and it was pleasure to learn machine learning under his guidance. He explained everything clearly and thoroughly. The course structure is clear and different themes are divided into their own sections which helps students a lot.  Programming exercises are well planned and easy to follow and if you need more help, there are also tutorials and other resources and discussion forum. The only minus (if it is worth mentioning) is maybe some mistakes in lecture video editing but it is so minor that it don't do anything.",5
1106,Sir Andrew Ng explains the concepts in a very simple manner but they are remarkable in depth. I am an engineering student and had only done linear algebra and calculus before in my college course. It took me quite some time to complete the programming  assignments but with the help of community and lecture notes I managed to succeed. ,5
1107,"Course is well structured and focuses on topics I feel are certainly useful for anyone wishing to become competent at applying machine learning. You'll gain knowledge and hopefully intuition of various popular ml algorithms, and just as importantly, you'll gain in-depth practical advice on how to tackle real ML projects. ",5
1108,"As a physicist with no background in machine learning, this course was an excellent way to get a thorough grasp on the basics and make connections to concepts that were already familiar to me, but in the context of machine learning. Topics are covered in enough detail to easily implement algorithms yourself, and you're given the tools to dive much deeper into the topics you're most interested in. I personally would have preferred, as optional material, a mathematically rigorous development of some of the material, but I appreciate that isn't for everyone. Thanks for a great learning experience! ",5
1109,"I almost gave up during Week 3 of the course. Even as someone with engineering, Matlab and programming experience, this course was by no means easy. But given confidence that Machine Learning was the future and it being taught by such a reputable lecturer, I pushed through after a month's break. ",5
1110,"This course was absolutely amazing! I loved it. I have learned quite a lot. Though I am an engineer and have background in programming, I started the course with zero knowledge in Machine Learning. I cannot wait to start applying what I have learned not just to my work but to my personal projects as well. A big thanks to Andrew Ng, his way of teaching is extremely clear. The assignments were fun and instructive as well. Thanks for Coursera for offering such a course. And thanks MathWorks for allowing to use Matlab online to complete the assignments. I am looking forward to take other courses :)",5
1111,"Really a great course which every should do to understand the mathematics and concepts behind Machine Learning before moving on to more complex topics such as Deep Learning. Convolutional Neural Networks etc. Andrew Ng takes this course way ahead of its competition by explaining key concepts thoroughly as well as making you brush up concepts through Quizzes and giving you an idea about how the implementation works with various assignments, some of which are challenging. Really a great course which is an absolute must for everyone looking to make a career in the field of Artificial Intelligence.",5
1112,"This course is excellent. Professor Ng presents the content in a way accessible to anyone, regardless of previous experience, or math skills.",5
1113,"This course is absolutely amazing. Initially I was doubting if reading an introductory book instead, and I'm tremendously happy I chose to take this course instead, because Andrew taught from the simplest topics but also some about advanced topics I wouldn't have reached by taking the same time reading a book. Also, I think the quizes and excercises were the most valuable part of the course, because they solidified the acquired knowledge and provided self confidence. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn machine learning. Thanks Coursera and Andrew!",5
1114,"Wonderful course ! I come from a background in game design, I'm more of an artist than an engineer ... Yet Professor NG's pedagogy helped me to go back to mathematical concepts I studied a very long time ago. This course changed my vision on the future of my field, and I will try to use what I learnt to be even more creative than before... I cried when I reached the conclusion video, thank you professor for thinking of the effort and the time we put into this course. After all, we don't really meet, but you manage to make us feel your passion for the field in your courses. Thank you very much !",5
1115,"This is a great start point for learners on Machine Learning. You get to know the basics of Supervised and Unsupervised learnings, Neural Networks, Debugging the Learning algorithm and lots of related topics. The course has hands-on programming assignments which reinforce the learning further. Not much mathematically intensive but just sufficient to understand the basic concepts. Anybody wishing to get the flavor of Machine Learning - this is the right start point. Also, the assignments are very practical including Spam Detection, Image Compression, Handwritten digit recognition, Movie recomme",5
1116,"The class is really practical and useful. Andrew has good techniques to give the courses, he can explain all the concepts and algorithms in a easy understanding way combining the practical and specific examples. If you have the background of higher mathematics and computer science, it’s a good option to choose this class to get the experience in machine learning. The structure and the arrangements of the class are both reasonable and systemic. The quizzes and coding exercise offered big help to understand for the theories and apply them in the realistic problems. I really recommend this class.",5
1117,"I really enjoyed how the concepts were taught starting from the basics. I liked how the topics were building off of each other, and many previous topics would still be mentioned in the relevant lectures of each week. I prefer instructors mentioning previous content, that way it helps me as a student, to connect previous concepts to the present. That connection allows me to get a better understanding and visualization of the various steps and mathematics behind machine learning. Thank you, this course gave me an eye-opening experience. I hope to take my knowledge one step further in the future.",5
1118,"The course is an excellent introduction to machine learning, and gives you the necessary tool to smoothly enter into the world of machine learning. The math is kept to the lowest possible and the course focuses on concepts and understanding how a machine learning system works, and how you should design it. Through many real application examples that we encounter in our daily lives, we learn how to program basic ML systems. Prof Ng teaches the subject clearly and the course material is excellent, quizzes are here to make sure you understand the main concepts and to give you a sense of progress.",5
1119,"This course is
excellent. I like the way Andrew structured the course and the experience he shared about real-life
implementation of the algorithms discussed in class.  I was stuck
at week 3 (logistic regression) and I almost gave up. I had to spend a few hours
reviewing week 3 and week 2 videos a few times before I finally got the idea.  Once I got a fair understanding of
logistic regression and gradient descent, the rest of the course is easy to
follow.  It is great that the lectures are broken down into short videos which allowed me to easily complete most of them on my train rides to work.",5
1120,"I would be forever grateful to Mr Andrew Ng for bringing up this course. When i first started exploring Machine Learning, the description of the perquisites (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and so much other mathematics topics) would scare me. It took me almost one year to finally take a dive and thanks to this course Machine Learning is no more a scary ghost. For me this is a beginning and a wonderful one into the exciting world of Machine Learning. And as my journey in this field progresses, i hope my gratitude for Andrew Ng and Coursera would grow with time like the taste of old wine.",5
1121,"I really appreciated the applied math emphasis and the programming exercises that forced me to ensure that I completely understood how to apply the math. It was the first time I've ever been able to actually finally put some use to all of the calculus that I've learned from other curriculums!!! Thank you for bringing so much value to my understanding of how to apply math to accomplish amazing things.
",5
1122,"I have only finished the first week of lessons so far, but this has already been an amazing course and I cannot wait to learn more in the upcoming videos. Professor Andrew Ng definitely knows what he is talking about and has abundant real world experience, meaning that he truly knows what is and isn't important to teach.",5
1123,Thank you Andrew for the course. It's excellent.,5
1124,"By far the most challenging, but at the same time most rewarding learning experience
in Coursera. Professor Andrew Ng wonderfully explains seemingly intricate
topics such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, K-Means Clustering in
a very intuitive and comprehensible approach as well as provides useful
practical hints. How is Netflix able to know what movies we might like? How
does Amazon decides which book we might find interesting? How are frauds or
anomalies detected?",5
1125,"I love pure mathematics and usually expect everything to be proved to me. Most of the material in this course is taught in a style of 'this is not important, just believe me' and I was initially not very happy about it.  But after completing the course I can say I don't mind. The material is still challening, and it really makes machine learning click for you, even though it does not prove it to you. It makes you build the stuff, which is simply extraordinary. YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN NEURALK NETWORK, YOUR OWN BRAIN RUNNING ON A PIECE OF ROCK IN YOUR COMPUTER, HOW COOL IS THAT? GO ON, SIGN UP! ",5
1126,"This was a wonderful course to have taken! Great content, very practical, and hands-on. Great balance between theory and application. Absolutely enjoyed the assignments! Instructor's tone and methods are great. Really appreciated all the real-world advice on what is important or not, where to spend time to improve or not.  The course is full of great useful tips for applying this technology, and it feels like a great amount of time and dedication was spent to make the material as accessible and useful and applicable as possible to every enthusiast. A BIG THANK YOU to Andrew Ng and his team!!",5
1127,"Anybody out there wondering whether they should start with this course or countless others that are available on the web, my advice is to start with this ML course. It gives you all of the basics and introductions to ML, Neural Networks, Back Propagation etc. I tried reading ML books and implemented Sci-kit based ML algorithms, but I kept running into concepts that I had not much knowledge of. Taking this course revealed all of those concepts to me. This course is truly worth your time and worthy of sticking with even when you get stuck after the first few weeks. Persevere and keep learning.",5
1128,"Great grounding in the just the right amount of detail of the most popular ML algorithms. Very clear and precise lectures, especially good when combined with the 'speed up' options.",5
1129,"Thank you, Andrew. This course is really helpful! I first take this course in 2016. And now, it is 2020, I review this course and I still learn a lot from it.  I also take your ""Deep learning Specialization"". You help me to change my career and now I am working as a data scientist. There are a lot of meaningful projects on Kaggle as well as my own job. I can use this technology to solve some problems. I feel very proud. By the way, I am now taking the tests on Workera. There are 7 courses and I have completed 2. I hope I can get the certificate from it and to be a ""real"" data scientist! :-)",5
1130,"It was a helpful course for a beginner like me; with lots of math, computation, and assignments. But I learned something valuable. I am sure all of us who have taken this course and all of us who will take this course will be greatly benefitted upon completion. But we've to grasp all the math and theory shown in this course by ourselves because that's how Computer Science works, the instructor won't teach us every detail. I wish I could personally thank Professor Andrew Ng for showing us a path and encourage us not to just do something for ourselves but for all people. Thank you, Professor.",5
1131,"a machine learning course of excellence like never before but the most astonishing remains that everything is explained with a pleasant simplicity, we really understand everything about machine learning so I want to personally thank Dr Andrew Ng because thanks to him I was a simple curious about machine learning I am now a connoisseur of the field, the videos, the quizzes everything is great being mathematicians I really loved explaining the fundamentals of each notion thank you very much to you Dr Andrew Ng for the love you have for sharing knowledge !!! best regards Orson Typhanel MENGARA",5
1132,"The course is perfect for beginners and anyone who wants to learn machine learning. Before this course I was a newbie in ML but after this course I've begun to dig deeper in the field and i really enjoy it. Most of the credit goes to Prof. Andrew Ng, for making this course so enjoyable and informative. Also, the programming exercises were really easy and fun to work out and see our code actually do some cool stuff. Also a big thank you to all the mentors especially Tom Mosher and Neil Ostrove who were really helpful and prompt. I would not be able to complete this course without their help!",5
1133,"The amount of time Andrew sir spent on this course made this course a very unique one. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and it helped me get a good strong foundation on the topics of Machine Learning. The advice and experiences Andrew sir has shared are very much valuable. My sincere thanks to the Coursera team for their efforts in making this world-class education possible. Last but not least my heartfelt and sincere thanks for providing me financial aid and help me get knowledge, certificate, and recognition. I'm sure I will make use of this for improving my life and other's life as well.",5
1134,"It was great great great course.
",5
1135,"The course was really lovely to me. I enjoyed the structure of the video lectures, whose difficulty levels gradually increased with adequate quizzes and programming assignments which gave a good hands-on feel of ML. Moreover, it's easier when you have basic knowledge of matrices, linear algebra and probability coupled with MATLAB  programming - I knew all these anyway. #Smiles.",5
1136,"This was a great first course in machine learning.  Professor Ng has captured the bare essence of the subject required to get someone to be a competent practitioner of machine learning, and has taught that material amazingly well, providing many fundamental insights along the way.  You will *not* get into deep mathematical derivations of the principles involved, but that is not the purpose of this course.  To maximize its effectiveness, I recommend really immersing yourself in the programming assignments and going above and beyond what is asked of you there.  I highly recommend this course!",5
1137,"I did not have any idea of ML before starting this course. I only had a good base on mathematics and I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in Greece. Following the course was really easy (in a sense that everything was explained perfectly) and I believe that through the programming assignments you get a very good feeling of how ML algorithms work. I haven't followed an ML course in my university so I don't know what else is out there, this course gave me the confidence to move on and further improve my knowledge. It is clearly one of the best organised courses I've seen on Coursera.",5
1138,This is a great class. An example of what MOOC classes should be. It is set up so that people of all levels can learn and understand. ,5
1139,"A very beginner friendly course that changed my life ! I started learning Machine Learning with this course as a second year undergrad and ended up doing a Deep Learning internship at CERN ( European Organization for Nuclear Research), Geneva for 2 months !",5
1140,"I definitely recommend this Course. Professor Andrew makes the hardest things so easy to understand. This course really gave me a good understanding about the main ML Algorithms and how to apply them. It also teach you a lot of applications of the same algorithms. The Course is half theoretical and half practical, so, if you are just like me, who needs to apply the knowledge I obtain to fully understand things, then this is definitely a Course for you. Also, if you have zero knowledge about ML or if you know just a little and want to get more in deep about ML, this is a great way to start.",5
1141,"Really cool course, Andrew Ng is a great teacher with an outstanding knowledge.",5
1142,"I have a complete newcomer when it comes to machine learning and was quite intimidated by all the formulas at first. I was surprised how well-structured this course is! The Instructor melts his rich and hands-on experience in machine learning down and integrates them into every video. The explanation is plausible and easy to follow. Through weekly exercises accompanying the learning process, you not only gets a deeper understanding of the contents but also an idea about what you are capable of doing even as a beginner. This course will be a booster in your new journey in machine learning!",5
1143,"The course is very detailed and instructional. Sometimes the discussion turn to be a little bit basic for people who have a knowledge of vector algebra. But the course is targeted for people with no knowledge of linear algebra too. So one may choose to skip those portions. I would really recommend an option of submitting the exercises in python too. I had to spend much time understanding correct way to vectorize the formulas in octave, which may be futile for me, as I may not continue programming in octave. Overall, the course is truly a firm first step for a beginner in machine learning.",5
1144,"I really enjoyed the course and found it an excellent introduction to machine learning. There is a good balance between theory and practice, with programming assignments most weeks. One minor area of improvement would be to have more optional lectures on the mathematics behind the algorithms, particularly for backpropagation and PCA. There seem to many people taking the course with at least some engineering / mathematics background and even a sketch of a proof can give more insight into how an algorithm works. This can of course be found elsewhere, but Prof Ng explains this stuff so well!",5
1145,"After accomplish many of knowledge from Andrew Ng, I think this course is the best course for beginner who want to learn Machine Learning with bottom-up approach manner. This course also designed for absolute newbie like me, I didn't stuck in any part because of lack of Calculus Background. In most case, the professor explains too clearly about many formula to use to coding. That's so impressive! But I think using Octave, Matlab (rather than Python, R...) is a disadvantage. Finally, I must say this course deserves the most typical, the most greatest for all of AI engineers in the future!",5
1146,"Great course ! I did this mooc in order to get started in machine learning as I am currently a master student in quantum computing and will potentially work on quantum machine learning in an internship. I ended up finishing this course in 3 weeks and having a lot of fun coding the exercises. I am really grateful for this because it was one of the best course I had as it can be done fast, if you put your mind to it, but also insightful.I am now thinking of applying machine learning to other projects I have and I believe this course might make a change in my career.Thus I deeply thank you.",5
1147,Excellent! I have a background in linear algebra and Matlab but ML is new to me. The flow of information is managed almost perfectly and I can follow very easily. I cannot image a more efficient way to learn about this topic. I especially appreciate the real life implementation insights from Andrew and how different tools are being applied at different settings. The support team also did a great job in responding to questions. Overall this is my best online learning experiences and I would definitely take other courses and recommend this to other people. Thanks for a great job well done.,5
1148,"I loved this course. I work in a small business and we thought machine learning was probably outside of the scope of what our small company could do. In only 11 weeks, I learned that wasn't true, but more importantly, I gained an abundance of practical knowledge about what could be done with machine learning and how to do it using tools anyone can afford (like Octave). I have already applied what I learned to one problem in my work and have plans to try several more in the next few weeks. Professor Andrew Ng was excellent and the course content was challenging, but well within my reach.",5
1149,"Excellent course. This is the first MOOC I have taken. I really appreciated the thorough analysis of the algorithms covered. I plan on taking the deep learning specialization taught by Andrew Ng. Because of this course, I have already implemented several algorithms from scratch in python with limited experience programming. I am now registering for 2 graduate level courses in my local university that are topics related to machine learning. I am also strongly considering doing a Ph.D in the field. Extremely well taught course, thank you very much Andew Ng and all the teaching assistants.",5
1150,"Without a doubt the first course anyone should take if they're interesting Machine Learning, AI, Deep Learning. It was definitely a journey, with lots of often difficult subjects to cover in a short space of time.",5
1151,"Very good course for professional who wants to learn machine learning in an efficient way.  Very practical, good advice and recommendations.  Very good balance on hand-on and theories.  This is very good stepping-stone course if you want  to continue the pursue learning understanding of the subject.  Thanks you very much, Andrew.   This is really the most effective way of learning for professional.  Your explanation of the class material is fantastic.  The recording method way of learning is excellent because I can always to view the video if there is something that I can't understand.  ",5
1152,"It was an incredible learning experience for me personally. I sign up for a lot of courses, but never end up completing any of those with the exception of this one, and this was only possible because of the amazing quality of the contents of this course and the unparalleled teaching style of Professor Ng. I was captivated by the sheer knowledge of Professor Ng in the field of Machine Learning and his humble way of presenting complex topics of this field encouraged me to propel through the course and finally complete it. Thank you Professor Ng, Coursera and everyone behind this course. ",5
1153,"This course is simply excellent. There are many online courses that superficially cover Machine Learning, but none of them explains everything as clearly as this one. Andrew Ng really  made sure that the student understands what's going on ""under the hood"" on many algorithms. And even though many libraries already implement these algorithms and there is no need to write them from scracth, by knowing how they work, it will be easier for us to tune some parameters to improve them. It doesn´t matter when you read this, if you want to really learn about Machine Learning, take this course!",5
1154,"Excellent material, very well put together and presented. It was nice that the programming exercises were approachable. Only worry I have about the programming exercises is that one does end up spending a lot of time debugging the vectorization aspects. While the knowledge thus gained might come handy, I probably would have preferred to spend more time working on core algorithm aspects. That said, programming assignments are tricky to get right and you guys did a great job providing a framework within which one could focus on the actual assignment rather than writing boilerplate code.",5
1155,"This course effectively covers important concepts and algorithms of Machine Learning. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K-means clustering are most impressive parts of the course.",5
1156,"Although the course is requiring some time to spend on to benefit from, the topics covered are very well introduced with accurate examples and explanations to understand the practical side of this topic. ",5
1157,"This is a very valuable course. I learned a lot about Machine Learning.  I am sure the knowledge that I gained can be applied endless. I must make a comment on the effort that has been taken by professor Andrew Ng. to teach the most complex concept in a simple manner. This is an enormous effort.   Providing facilities for making notes, lectures notes at the end of sessions are really useful  and you can study in a paperless world. Discussion forum and prompt response from Tom is beyond expectations and excellent. I sincerely thank professor Ng for taking me to a new world.  ",5
1158,"This course breaks down machine learning all the way to the basic nuts and bolts - with great explanations of the maths, followed by illustrations of the intuition behind it. Very often I found myself asking myself a question, only to have Andrew answer it soon after. The programming exercises take this philosophy further, are well-designed and very rewarding to work through. ",5
1159,"Excelente curso, muy interesante, te entrega las herramientas y el conocimiento para comenzar a implementar tus propias ideas. Te mantiene activo en el curso y ademas te entrega ejemplos reales que te ayudan a imaginar que puedes realizar con tus conocimientos actuales. Ademas el profesor Andrew es excelente.",5
1160,"This Andrew Ng's course is 100% recommended to everyone who wants to start working or managing machine learning projects, either individually or in teams. A world of opportunities will open as you complete each module, and you will leave the course inspired to do more and to learn more. Engineers (like me) with background in calculus, linear algebra and probability will probably find machine learning is going to be the major application of that knowledge in their professional lives. Businesses have a lot to gain by investing their employees' time in this course, and individuals, too. ",5
1161,"The course is very detailed, the instructor explains all steps very rigorously. The tests are hard, but generally constructive, they help the deep understanding of the course material. It is a pity that practical programming exercises are in Octave/Matlab, a Python or R based course would be better. This way a lot of efforts were made how to transform formula given in a sum form into vectorized form in Octave, instead of focusing on the Machine Learning content. Compared to similar courses at CNAM or at Harvard, it help the most the understanding of the essential of Machine Learning.",5
1162,"The course is very enlightening and provides a great overview of many modern ML techniques, while also going into more detail on some of the most powerful algorithms. I've greatly enjoyed the practical elements of the course, in the form of programming assignments and examples,  because they helped solidify my understanding and make sure I remember the details better. The only thing I would improve is more mathematical rigor and proofs (possibly optional). I think that would make the material even more understandable and memorable, at least for the more theoretically minded students.",5
1163,"This course is my first on-line course, a course I profusely enjoyed the learning the subject ML. The structure of the course is so well organized, it does help in referring back to earlier weeks coverage to understand the present week's tutorial. Pretty much focuses on fundamentals, while I know there is more to learn.",5
1164,The method of teaching and learning is very efficient. Work assignments to do our own algorithm helps a lot to put into practice the theory of the videos.,5
1165,"The course gives a very good overview on the different types of machine learing, their mathematical concepts, and applications. Andrew gives enough details to understand how the methods work - without getting lost in mathematical or computational details. The programming exercises are very well designed, they could be a bit more open/challenging as a lot of parts are already prepared. The only improvement I can suggest: The course should assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of calculus (derivation), algebra (matrix multiplication), or statistics (Gaussian distribution).",5
1166,"Thanks Andrew Ng for his wonderful teaching.This is my first course that I have completed in the Coursera. In fact, I have known Coursera when I was a university student. But because some problems like poor network which caused I can't watch the video, my own laziness and so on, I just have finished my first course until today. Since Alpha Go won the game, Artificial Intelligence becomes really popular, every company and media are talking AI will change our future, let so many people lost their jobs. So, if you don't want to be left behind by others, come here to start your learning.",5
1167,"Although being a software engineer, I was out of touch of mathematics for a long time, and hence was very skeptical whether I would be able to keep up with the pace of this course (along side my other priorities from work), but the content of the course was laid out so well, with just the right amount of quizzes/exercises that I was easily able to keep up and finish the course well within time.",5
1168,"This course is an absolute treasure. Straight from the Stanford itself! Andrew Ng has been my idol and inspiration since forever, and the experience of being a student of such an iconic personality in the domain of Computer Science is no less than an achievement for me. The layout of the course is just perfect and the teaching pedagogy is so good that i just can't explain it in words. This world is in a dire need for teachers like Dr. Ng. Thank you so much Coursera and Dr. Andrew Ng for giving me this valuable oppotunity to learn something that I loved and fantasized about the most.",5
1169,"Excellent introduction to machine learning. This is a fantastic roadmap to begin trailblazing your way through the industry if you want to get more advanced. Don't get confused, this is not equivalent to a B.S. in ML but compare this course to a +$60,000 bachelor's/master's degree, and you'll find that this is far more economically sound. Now you just need to read some books and do some projects and you'll be set to be just as good as the graduate.",5
1170,"Highly recommended.  I came to this course after floundering in another ML course.  Now I believe I have a much better understanding of the topic, tools, and skills needed.  There's so much great information that it's difficult to pick what seems to have helped me most . The class has 11 weeks of lectures and Professor Ng is very good at explaining the topics. The exercises in Octave helped establish the matrix mathematical concepts for me and allowed tweaking to see the effects of changes in real time. (I also didn't know about Octave, and now I've installed it on all my machines.)",5
1171,This is really THE course to start with machine learning. You get both insights for understanding each of the algorithms presented and the big picture of a whole machine learning project. Very useful practical advice is provided to ensure quality tests and optimize your time to spend it in the main bottlenecks throughout the machine learning pipeline. The topics covered are very well chosen too and putting hands-on work with the programming assignments really helps to settle the knowledge. The instructor is very motivating. He is able to break complex ideas in pieces easy to digest.,5
1172,"This class will teach you the basics of ML and gives a very good introduction and overview of the ML domain. I have learned a lot and have the feeling that I am a lot more capable to apply machine learning myself. Also for other people: you only need basic calculus, linear algebra and statistics knowledge like partial derivatives, matrix multiplication and Gaussian distributions to understand this course. Also because a lot of people already have taken this class, nearly every question is already asked in the discussion forum, so you have instant access on answers of your questions.",5
1173,Absolutely BRILLIANT!!  I am a lecturer myself (have been for 10+ years) and I have been truly inspired by Andrew Ng's teaching style and approach to learning. I learned so much from this course - and my enthusiasm for the field has grown exponentially as a result. Frankly - I didn't want the course to end. I highly recommend this course - and I also strongly recommend taking the time to complete the exercises/quizzes. You'll get so much more out of it if you do.  Special thanks to Andrew Ng and all of his collaborators. Congrats on producing an absolute classic in online learning.,5
1174,"Merci beaucoup à Andrew Ng et Coursera, pour cette introduction assez complète, aux algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique (machine learning). J'ai notamment apprécié les exemples et les exercices, qui traitent de cas concrets. Ce cours est vraiment accessible, à ceux dont les mathématiques sont déjà un lointain souvenir. J'envisage de suivre la spécialisation proposée par le formateur, pour approfondir le sujet. Avant même la fin du cours, j'ai commencé à mettre en application ces algorithmes dans le cadre d'un projet personnel, et cela donne des premiers résultats encourageants.",5
1175,"I'd like to say that the best part of this course is the assignments, great guiding & great explaining, (obviously the author put lots of thought to design them, I should say thanks!) though these exercises are not easy especially for beginners, but it's worth devoting my time to work them out, I took double (maybe triple)the time to do these assignments as watching the videos, and I learned a lot from it, it helped me gain a much deeper understanding of the algorithms, learn by doing is the best way. hope this comment will be helpful for those who just trying to start this course.",5
1176,"Great course for intro to ML. Covers most relevant topics and gave me enough hands on exercises to solidify the underlying concepts of ML. This is not a TensorFlow or DeepLearning4j course but more of the fundamentals that those type of libraries are based on. Perfect for establishing a foundation for ML and Dr. Ng , can't say enough. Excellent presentation of the materials in a concise and clear manner. The resources for the course are also excellent supplements to the course material (Quizzes and Assignments). No regrets on taking this class for me as a introduction to the topic.",5
1177,"This is a great course. I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting, never boring way. ",5
1178,"Excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the Machine Learning. Very good, structured, easy to follow and understand course for anyone whose has previous exposure to linear algebra using MATLAB and Octave.",5
1179,"it's a huge honor to pass the most enthusiastic course of my life with professor Andrew ng. of course I've learned lots of things here in this course, and I want to say thanks not only to professor Andrew ng but also all Coursera staff for all their efforts and supporting me at financial support affairs. I've lost my father recently, but I'm sure he will be happy that I'm still trying to be strong to keep on learning to reach my goals. finally, I want to say thanks for giving me this opportunity.",5
1180,"A great resource for beginners in the subject. Challenging for those beginners, mainly the programming exercises, but the deal is that the course is really fine tuned and after completing it you will have much more than just shallow knowledge about the subject. It is also amazing to see already in the first weeks of the course how powerful some simple math you already know are - the same techniques you use two calculate the equation of the line that best fits a few points in the space is going to be used to recognize handwritten text, faces and a lot of other real world scenarios.",5
1181,"I love the teaching style of Prof. Andrew. He takes you through behind-the-scenes of magic of regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, support vector machines in a very lucid manner. Apart from that, there is ample advice on how to build production level machine learning systems along with examples such as recommendation system, photo OCR application. Programming assignements focus on implementation of concepts taught in the lectures. Most things are in place and all we need to is to code the functions. Thank you Prof. Andrew and Coursera for this wonderful course.",5
1182,"It is really an outstanding course for students interested in machine learning, especially college students major in computer or other similar majors. I really want to thank every one contributing themselves in this course such as professor Ng and TAs. I've really learned a lot about machine learning from this course. And I really recommend anyone who wants to learning something about machine learning to take this course. You can see the efforts behind this course made by lots of enthusiastic people, and anyway, it's the best entry level course of machine learning I've every seen. ",5
1183," El curso es perfecto, no pensé que lograría terminarlo, Aprendí cosas muy valiosas, que espero me ayuden a comprender mejor como funciona el mundo de los algoritmos computacionales. ",5
1184,I'd like to use this opportunity to thank Prof. Ng and all the mentors that answered my questions cross out the training. It was a huge step for someone with a Zero IA knowledge.,5
1185,This is an excellent course for beginners in the field of Machine learning and even for intermediate people. Because our instructor Andrew Ng has explained the basics of mathematics and computer science behind the big picture of machine learning. It is clearly explained that it takes simple mathematics to form a big complex idea to make the machines learn. I felt very happy to be part of this course and to be a student under Andrew Ng. Thanks for making this course available with great content for free. Hope we will find more courses with this type of content and from Andrew Ng.,5
1186,"The course design is really good, the depth is considered to be intermediate. The course provides a good overview to predictive modelling and teach statistics in a more computational way which I found it is quite challenging ( in a very positive way). I had both computer and statistics background and still quite enjoy the course. I completed the course in about 7-8 weeks. But I recon it would take more than 11 weeks without computer science and statistics background. I highly recommend the course if you want to deep dive into analytical machine learning world. Well done, Andrew.",5
1187,"I'm surprised how professional and helpful this course is, how much effort was put to prepare the videos, the questions during them, tests, and programming assignments. I also prepared something that can be called an online course and I know that it's a huge work to do. Thank you very very much. What I found very valuable is the additional topics about algorithm analysis, debugging, diagnostics, error analysis and so on. I felt sort of shivers of excitement, since I knew the expert was sharing his knowledge based on his large experience. Now I can say I'm a student of Andrew Ng.",5
1188,"Incredible course!  Andrew Ng broke down machine learning into manageable steps and provided invaluable instruction.   In a few months, I went from knowing very little about ML to being able to understand how many types of ML algorithms work.  The math for me was the most difficult part so I used Khan Academy and the book Deep Learning (first few chapters) to review the stats + linear algebra.  A really good supplementary podcast that helped a lot is ""Machine Learning Guide"" which helped me understand the material from a conceptual/high-level view.  Highly recommend this course!",5
1189,"I really enjoyed this course. I think, it is so important to determine what you want from this course. This isn't a course to teach you how to use Python's machine learning libraries like scikit-learn neither pytorch or any other thing. During this course, you are going to learn the concepts behind most of traditional machine learning algoritms from a simple Linear Regression to more advanced topics such as Neural Network and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA). Professor Andrew NG does his best to convery all topics in a simple manner without being overwheled with theoritical idea.",5
1190,"My journey into the world of machine learning just started with a strong foundation through this course. Through theoretical consolidation of the topic and rigorous mathematical jargon, this course also gave me a good intuition and better understanding of how the underlying mechanism of machine learning gives rise to a seemingly intelligent system. A good portion of the course focus on the big picture of a machine learning system , connecting dots of small details to build a large working system. Anyone who wants to learn the basics of data science , this course is recommended.",5
1191,"I have been taking online courses in every summer to improve myself on specific areas since 2013. This course earned my appreciation and will be remembered as one of the best prepared - detailed course I ever seen including courses that I took physically from university. Additionally, this course became source of self-confidence to me in area of algebra and mathematic.",5
1192,"Verry structured course that gives you a great overview of the field of machine learning and a lot of practical tips. Treats the mathematics very efficiently and does not go to much into the derivation or proof of the formulas (if you are really interested in that: the internet is full of sources where you can find this info). However, the course still develops a really good intuition for the formulas, which is really useful to have some understanding of the alorithms. Overall I can say that you see that the tutor has put a lot of effort in preparing this course. Thanks a lot!",5
1193,"Despite the fact that the most in-demand course is free of cost, Prof Andrew Ng teaches it as best as it can be taught to beginners (like me), who does not know anything about machine learning (altought have to know at-least basic to intermediate maths concepts). The explanation of complex mathematical algorithms and concepts are made very simple and interesting... I hope this turns out to be beneficial and practically useful for me as i progress thought the course.",5
1194,"Best course ever! Amazing combination of theory, practical coding and quizzes/tests and brilliant support structure around it - Tutorials, test cases, programming guidance etc.",5
1195,"Great introduction to machine learning! It's just enough math so that the algorithms aren't strictly treated like black boxes. It may not have the same mathematical rigor as the original Stanford course, but you can always go to the publicly available notes to get more insight on each of the algorithms. I did get stuck on the programming assignments a few times, and in these cases course mentors proved to be absolutely indispensable. The mentors provided immensely helpful guides for the programming assignments. I'm now looking forward to reviewing the original course content!",5
1196,"Great course, really taught what we need to know for applications while also showing the deeper mathematics involved. I liked how each class had real-life examples to give more context to the algorithms. The programming exercises were also great! They were simple enough for someone to do them without having others look at their code, but were also informative in understanding the linear algebra and implementation of algorithms. For someone hoping to start out in ML, I would highly recommend. It's no wonder every website recommends this course as the best online course for ML!",5
1197,"This is an excellent class for anyone beginning to learn Machine Learning (caveat is that you somewhat need to know linear algebra unless you can easily follow Professor Ng's word for matrix addition/subtraction/multiplication/division).  Professor Ng teaches the concepts thoroughly and in a manner that non-technical people can understand!  The coding assignments were perfect complexity (not too hard, not too easy) and Teaching Assistants' notes are super helpful.  I learned so much in this course and feel confident that I can speak about Machine Learning in my organization.",5
1198,I had very little idea about machine learning and this course has taught me not only the basics and definitions but how to apply what I have learnt to data. The programming exercises helped me understand and apply the steps to a machine learning problem. The examples and applications in the videos provided motivation for creating new research ideas. Professor Ng's guidance and clear step-by-step methods allows a beginner to grasp the content in minutes and the assignments further strengthen the basics. Thank you Professor Ng and Coursera for providing such a wonderful class.,5
1199,"Very good course. I feel like the pace was perfect. It was challenging and required that you really learned what Andrew was teaching, but structured and guided enough (especially in the programming assignments when some of the less relevant technical programming was taken care of) that you could learn and focus on the concepts rather than the ancillary technical knowledge needed to progress.",5
1200,"Excellent foundational learning for anyone interested in engaging with machine learning. The course prioritizes strategy as much as technique, making it particularly relevant even now as widely available tools have increased the accessibility of applying machine learning without specific programming knowledge. For those who are interested in the programming side, the assignments provide insight and intuition as to the nature of machine learning at a fundamental level that could easily influence your choices in building your own models and best applying your time and energy.",5
1201,"I enjoyed this course so much. The quizzes were challenging enough to get you engaged with the material you've just learned. The programming assignments where enjoyable for me to work through since I have spent months trying to find the best MATLAB projects for me as an aspiring data scientist to do.  I have come to understand the intuition of stuff that I couldn't describe well enough such as the NN back propagation algorithm, kernels in SVM and K-Means clustering. Now I have more appreciation of machine learning and mathematics. Thank you Andrew Ng for making this course. ",5
1202,"I am not a calculus expert. But, thanks to professor Andrew approach, I think I have now a pretty good intuition on all of this stuff works. I loved every single video, advice, lecture & exercise from this course. it took me 3 months and I have learned so much and now, I know how long is the path to keep learning. I have so many ideas and I am now comfortable dealing with my team of engineers to express my use cases. I knew Standford University was one of the greatest University in the world. Now, I know why. THANK YOU so much for this course. Eager to jump on another one ! ",5
1203,"The course is fantastic, Dr. Andrew Ng has elaborated very clearly each part of the content all the way down the course, the content is well-designed and organised, to let me have a good exposure to different parts of machine learning. Now I have a much better understanding in each part of this field, the exercises and quizzes are definitely helpful for letting me to grasp the key concepts of each topic, would definitely introduce this course to anyone who has interest or passion to learn more in the world of Data Science and Machine Learning, what a great learning journey!",5
1204,"I am in the middle of the course, but I have already made my opinion. I think it is really great course. I have never felt so good feeling from studying. I'm so thankful for Andrew NG's work and he is master of his craft. Very nice and pleasant teacher. I wish I have such teachers at school and university.
",5
1205,"This is the best course in for machine learning available on net. Prof. Ng teaches very well. He explains all the concepts in a simple way. I liked the intuition part, how the algorithm is actually related to the problem we are trying to solve and how its different components are mapped to different parts of the problem. This should be the first machine learning course for anyone who is trying to get into field of machine learning. ",5
1206,"Dear Professor, thank you  so much for  your nice teaching.  I've learned a lot from this course about machine learning, and I feel so happy for that. Yes, I know machine learning contains a  very large of knowledge,  and what you've mentioned in this course is just the tip of the iceberg. I  do appreciate  a lot that  you've given us a clear and intelligible  introduction to machine learning,  which is quite important for new hands. Thank you again. As you said,  hope to make our life better with machine learning as a useful tool, I will keep going and learning on this.  ",5
1207,"This course covers a lot of ground of ML applications, and while it doesn't go into the theoretical depth that some of the other classes do, it gives a very nice hands-on feel for what it's like to run ML algorithms. ",5
1208,"This was a fantastic course and I am very grateful to Andrew Ng and all the mentors for their enormous work and dedication to support us learning. Prof Ng explains everything in grate detail and still clear and logical, whereas the mentors have gone beyond word ""patience"" when it comes to guidance through the programming assessments. I have myself not programmed for over 10 years and thanks to Tom Mosher and his tutorials plus endless source of information that are the Course's Discussion Forums, I was still able to solve the programming questions. Thank You all very much!",5
1209,"A rewarding experience completing the course and learning new things about ML. As many have reviewed, Prof. Andrew Ng is just awesome in explaining the topics with clarity and simple language. He can almost sense when the topic gets heavy in math and eases any concerns by directing the focus to main takeaways rather than elaborate derivations. The assignments are nicely balanced as well with interesting applications. Starter code for the assignments are well structured so people with limited programming experience can do the assignments without too much trouble. Thank you!",5
1210,"Machine Learning is the first course I have completed on Coursera. I have heard Andrew Ng before, who has a great influence and reputation in the field of Machine Learning. But until I listened his courses, I never know that he is actually a cute guy and  pretty serious in teaching. I bet all you guys have seen him looking his notes when he turns on the camera. With the effort of all the staff, the courses are really comprehensive and understandable for anyone. Thank you Andrew for the wonderful courses and thank Coursera for the opportunity to learn so many things online.",5
1211,"Great introduction to machine learning. This course permits to better understand which algorithm is the most suitable depending of the results we want to obtain. It also permits to acquire good practices to set, validate and optimize performance of a learning algorithm. It explains how works most of machine learning algorithms by detailing clearly the calculations performed. This seems to me really  important to know a bit about the calculations performed rather than using built-in models directly without knowing anything about how it works inside it. Thank you Andrew Ng!",5
1212,"This course teaches the fundamentals of ML and also explains very well the intuitions behind the algorithms, which is in my opinion priceless.",5
1213,"Thank you very much for these course. It was really amazing. This is my first step into machine learning. These course is just perfect: maximum of essential information, programming exercises and complex quizzes. Andrew explained complex thing in an easy and understandable way. Though I studied Math in the University long time ago (back then I didn't understand why we were learning such complex things), it was easy to follow Andrew's explanations. Andrew inspires, he keeps you being curios. I wish I had teachers like him in the University, I would never miss my classes :)",5
1214,"Course was well taught, and well paced. Covered each topic clearly and concisely, and provided places to further expand on later. Course was primarily mathematical, but also gives a lot of practical and implementation guidance as well. Programming assignments were interesting, and helped reinforce the concepts from lecture. Documentation for programming assignments could probably be made clearer, and can sometimes be difficult to figure out on your own, but the resources on the forums made up for this easily. Overall, felt like I definitely learned a lot from this course.",5
1215,"Excellent course, much more than I could have hoped for. Completely changed my views and approach to machine learning and gave me a very solid foundation moving forward. Only issue I have is that the class is in Matlab (I understand that data science in Python was not as developed when this course was made as it is now, but perhaps the programming exercises could be rewritten in Python?), and that some of the advice/select concepts are outdated/wrong so those could stand to get edited. These minor things would improve upon the great quality of an already excellent course!",5
1216,"Nunca había hecho un curso en linea, pero ahora estoy seguro de que haré muchos más en el futuro, el profesor tiene un tono de voz agradable, los temas se entienden muy bien, la dificultada de las tareas programadas diría que el la necesaria para consolidar los conceptos que se recorren a lo largo del curso. Totalmente recomendado, desde la tercera semana se trabajan con aplicaciones muy interesantes y en general el esfuerzo se ve recompensado con aplicaciones y resultados fascinantes. Es necesario dedicar tiempo y esfuerzo pero lo vale completamente. Muchísimas gracias!",5
1217,"Still a great course and with 10 weeks of study, as opposed to the 4 available in the  'intro to deep learning' course, Andrew has time to get into some nitty gritty detail. As ever, he explains concepts with diagrams/pictures and simple(ish) maths. 2yrs later and after doing many other data science courses, I am pleased I started with Andrews' first course in machine learning. Only down side is that it requires use of Matlab. Nothing wrong with Matlab per se, its actually a nice environment to work in, but no other courses use Matlab. Other courses are all Python and R.",5
1218,I've learned tons of fundamental theories about machine learning system as well as plenty of programming skills. Maybe because I'm a software engineer mainly using C it was very impressive that the vectorization implementation can highly reduce the code lines and has advance in the efficiency in runtime. Thank you very much Andrew Ng for this course that would let me go forward in this field. I recommend this course for all of who is frightened of lots of mathematics thus jib at diving in this field because professor Ng explains the whole things easy and straightforward.  ,5
1219,Professor Andrew Ng has done a tremendous job in compiling course material and designing problems in a way that progressively instills key Machine Learning concepts in the student's mind. This is a must course for anyone trying to get an understanding on what machine learning is and enables almost anyone to be able to apply machine learning in their field. Great thing about it is that every person taking this course may come up with a novel application of machine learning that's not only good for an individual or a company but may also improve lives of people in general.,5
1220,"Really, thank you, Ng. Your course is amazing and I can see that you have put a lot into this class and I have learned a lot. You are like a great mentor and make us students get passionate about this field. I really thank you very much and hope you will always be well.",5
1221,"This course presents relevant topics for machine learning in a very didatic way and in a very interesting sequence. The teacher really knows the topic, the comunity is engaging and the material is really well crafted. I totally recommend this to you if you already have a little programming background (matlab is a plus). If you don't, i sincerely recommend that you study a little matlab and linear algebra, although this is not 100% required for passing the tests, it is essential for your complete understanding of the subject. (Note, i'm currently at week 5 of the course).",5
1222,"Un curso impresionante, inclusive para quienes (como yo) tienen experiencia previa en cursos de nivel universitario en aprendizaje automático. El profesor es extraordinario, y las clases son excelentemente llevadas adelante por el profesor, quien es un GURU en la materia. Absolutamente recomendado.",5
1223,"This is the best course for someone who wants to get into Machine Learning. Although the course is in MATLAB/Octave, it doesn't matter, since it focusses more on the theory and the maths behind the algorithms. You will develop strong intuition about what works and what doesn't and will have a strong foundation. The most important aspect of this course is the instructor, Andrew Ng. He is just so warm and the way he teaches is so good, I've never had a better teacher than him. This was hands down the best class I've ever taken and almost felt nostalgic at the final video.",5
1224,"My sincere thanks to Andrew NG for taking the classes and making the videos available for free so that everyone interested should be able to learn. I thank from the bottom of the heart in developing this great website, which also offers the trainings, evaluation of exercises and also asking questions during the class. I felt as if I have been in one of the room in an university. When I see the thank you slide in the last slide, it was such nostalgic moment, and I feel like missing. ",5
1225,,5
1226,This is a great introductory course. ,5
1227,"I found this course occasionally. After I started the first video, I could not stop watching it. I finished this course in two weeks, and I put a lot of time on it almost every day, watching the videos, repeating it if I had some questions, doing the fun programming exercises, and so on.",5
1228,This is a great course for anyone wanting to start machine learning. Prof. Andrew Ng covers many topics of machine learning in both supervised and unsupervised learning. The way the concepts are explained are really nice and this makes the course very engaging. Another one great thing about this course is the programming assignments that we get after completing a week's lecture. The programming assignments cover most of the concepts explained in the video and we have to implement algorithms ourselves so it gives a better insight and intuition of what's really going on.,5
1229,"I had never thought I would ever dive into the actual mathematics and programming that it takes to build a model. I was anxious and maybe even afraid to get on with this course given I'm from the mechanical background, hoping to use Machine learning in my domain. But our instructor, Andrew made these lectures so much easier to understand and I had a lot of fun working through the programming assignments as well! I also want to thank Andrew for putting together this wonderful masterpiece that takes any newbie through machine learning like a walk in the park! Thank you!",5
1230,"Muy interesante al vez que muy útil. Hay lecciones mas claras que otras pero por lo general creo que se debe a que mi nivel de inglés ( que no es muy alto y leer subtítulos que en ocasiones iban muy rápido casi sin tiempo de leerlos). De todas formas se entiende perfectamente. Quiero remarcar también el foro ayuda muchísimo cuando en algún momento te quedas un poco atascado. Esta todo muy bien estructurado y los conceptos muy bien explicados. Quiero agradecer que me brindaran la oportunidad de disfrutar de este curso, en concreto al profesor Andrew Ng. Thank you too!!",5
1231,"Overall, the course is an excellent way to get a basic understanding of how Machine Learning works and how it is applied. The course is comprehensive enough that you can even build a simple Machine Learning app that will work.
",5
1232,"Excellent introduction into ML and the thought processes/strategies on how to spend time/resources in a ML project. Suggestions for improvement would be to: 1) Modify the videos to highlight/footnote when there is errata as we are watching.  2) Provide additional simple to follow numerical examples for some of the lectures (i.e. neural network, probability). The additional test cases in the forum help but it would be useful to have a few more.  3) The HW notes are great to get the HW done but sometimes allows us to get the HW done w/o fully understanding the material.",5
1233,"A brilliant class with a wonderful teacher and his illustrating instruction! Although this class does not require you to have much experience on programming or to be comfortable with math, you can still learn a lot from the well-designed chapters. Those algorithm, in my perspective, are the most useful parts of this class, which gave you much potential to develop your further skills on whatever machine learning or on your other computer technique. Finally, I wanna thanks to Pro. Ng. that I was given an opportunity to come over the first step of programming. Thank you!",5
1234,"Thanks ......................... for having such a great thing easily and freely accessible to everyone, who want to learn. ",5
1235,Very well put together course. The lectures are logically structured and well presented with lots of meaningful and current examples. The Matlab programming assignments have been well thought out to incrementally step the student up through the different capabilities. ,5
1236,"Best course I've tried on Coursera! The instructor explains things really well, and the exercises are extremely helpful in implementation. You don't need to write the whole implementation, which saves a lot of time, but you still need to implement the critical parts, and the instructions lead you through the whole process very clearly. In general, I enjoyed the videos and exercises a lot, and I learned a lot from the intuition of the methods to the practical implementation, as well as how to assess and improve them. Would recommend to anyone interested in the topic!!",5
1237,"I loved it!
Such an excellent course on Machine Learning. I enjoyed the way Professor
Andrew Ng explained the ""intuition"" behind the algorithms and the matrices
and vectors manipulation. What a great teacher!  He made the course easy to understand with the
understandable examples and the well explained theories. I also enjoyed the
assignments and how well structured and instructive they are. I could tell that
you enjoyed the course as well Professor Andrew!  Thank you for your time and effort. Thank you
for sharing your experience with us and I wish you all the best!",5
1238,"  Extremely good course to start with machine learning. Clears basic concepts without going into too much detail which makes it ideal for students with no background in calculus. Also, the structure and content is well organized and topics are not rushed upon. You not only learn algorithms but also best practrices to follow to achieve better accuracy. The programming exercises are also really good. All of this makes coupled with the helpful Coursera community to guide you when you are stuck- up with a problem makes it an ideal course to start learning machine learning.  ",5
1239,"Hello everyone, I hope these lines help potential new students to decide whether or not to take this course. To start with I have to tell you that in no time you will realize that Andrew put a lot of passion here, along with a clear organization of the themes. All coding tasks are well designed to complete the understanding of the theoretical videos. Also, the resources, especially the test cases, are well configured.
",5
1240,"As an experienced software developer and technology leader, I have an ongoing desire to continue to improve myself.  I've long wanted to take this course, but let time be an excuse.  I am very glad I finally made the time for it.  Andrew is very thorough and detail oriented and presents the material in a manner that makes it easy to learn.  I am looking forward to applying the concepts and techniques taught in this course to personal and professional projects.  I am also taking excited to take the Deep Learning Specialization as I am sure it will be time well spent.",5
1241,This course is very much effective in learning new concepts of machine learning.,5
1242,This was the first online course I've ever participated in and it was a pleasure. All the material was very well though out. The lectures were concise and mixed theory and practice in a balanced way. The programming exercises were challenging but once I completed them I felt I could really implement what I'd learned to tackle real machine learning problems. The exercises  were designed so that instant feedback was available. This was crucial for programming is very much a trial and error process. Thanks to Andrew Ng and all the people who made this course available.,5
1243,"I thought this course was brilliant; very interesting and educational. I had not studied machine learning before, but Andrew Ng did a fantastic job of summarising the topics and explaining them to us in an accessible way. The programming assignments were great; they were challenging at times but that meant I learnt a lot from completing them. They were also  very interesting, for example one covered the use of neural networks for handwritten digit recognition. I've come away genuinely excited at the prospect of learning more and putting the techniques into practice. ",5
1244,"This class provides a lot of foundational wisdom that can be applied to any machine learning application. I strongly believe that anyone interested in this subject should study and master this material. Professor Ng is clearly very knowledgeable and does an excellent job of outlining the way industry leading machine learning engineers think and solve problems. I appreciated that he tried to cater to the more mathematically inclined by at least mentioning the more advanced theory, while not letting excessive rigor impede clear explication of the fundamental concepts.",5
1245,"I started this course with zero knowledge about machine learning and ended up being confident that i can now solve many machine learning problems in real life In-sha-Allah. A very good machine learning course conducted by a very best instructor Andrew Ng. His sophisticated representation really helped me to go through these long 11 weeks course. So, Thank You Prof. Ng! I would also like to thank Coursera for bringing this course to us. If anyone interested in machine learning, i just want to say them this course worth 11 weeks of your valuable life. Happy Learning! ",5
1246,"Thank you so much for teaching the most sought field of this century in such a simplistic way. I really enjoyed the course and after completion of every assignment, I have improved a better understanding of the particular subject. I hope to improve more on my knowledge and techniques that I learned from this course and apply to real-world problems to make human life a lot easier. I also thank the mentor's team who have helped me in a better understanding of the particular subject. Once again, Thank you so much dear Andrew sir, mentors, and the entire coursera team.  ",5
1247,"Thank you very much Mr.Ng and all the Coursera team. After 12 years from the end of my pretty brilliant but hard student career I've never deepen dive in new technical issues. Online courses didn't exist at that time (oh Gosh, how I'm old...), and thinking that a group of people can create all this mainly for the good of others (obviously you deserve every money if you get business on that) is really inspiring me. I had  three real intense weeks to finish this course, but I'm really happy, even if I'm not sure I will use this know-how in my future. Thank you again.",5
1248,"I'm very happy to learn \ join this class. I am a researcher student and I have used machine learning algorithms in my research, and I have spent a lot of time being interested in the results without being interested in the algorithms I use because I didn't know how they work or how to make them work, but now that I have enough knowledge to use them correctly. So thank you very much. the course is simple in terms of presentation, accessible to all, very valuable. the most wonderful thing is to describe in a simple way very complex mathematical ideas and equations.
",5
1249,"1 The session was very enlightening. Coming from a Mathematics and Computer Science background, this taught me a lot and helped me further appreciate the connect of the two streams I did my advanced studies in. ",5
1250,"Carefully laid out course material that dymstifies the hype and sheds light on the theoretical /mathematical basis of ML. The support code, quizzes and lectures are excellent material for one who wants to take a deeper dive and explore/extend the basic concepts further. ",5
1251,"Professor Ng was awesome. Juts awesome!. My first ever e-learning that I completed. Initially I didn't have the idea of paying for the course. But once after moving through initial sessions, I realized that its worth to invest on this to take the course even more seriously. Without doubt this is the best place on earth to begin with Machine Learning or AI. I bet on it. And I can't never forget Professor Ng's words.. ""If you don't understand it now, don't worry about it"". I always smiled when he says that because he mean it cent percent and I understood that later.",5
1252,This is a great course. The instructor Andrew Ng carries you through the material in easy to understand lectures that are divided by topic in perfectly timed video sessions with individual quizzes during each video that help you gauge how well you have understood and grasped the topic discussed in the lesson. This prepares you to take the graded quizzes and complete the programming projects.,5
1253,"This has been one of the best courses I have ever taken.  It is also my first on-line training and I was, at first, skeptical about how it would go - especially when I inevitably would hit a block.  But Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher who conveys complex concepts in a digestible way.  I recommend his course to anyone looking to learn how ML works and how to apply it in real life.  I cannot thank Andrew and Coursera enough for providing me the chance to learn such a powerful skill at such an affordable price.  This is democratisation of education at it's finest! ",5
1254,,5
1255,Very informative and useful course that covers the basics of machine learning to begin with and all other aspects to make one understand and dive deep into machine learning programming.,5
1256,"This is the best Machine Learning class I ever took, after taking several ML classes in real life and online. Unlike most other ML courses focusing on math, this class specifically emphasizes on how to analyze/debug a system. The programming exercises are extremely well-organized and helpful in implementing the algorithms and debug the performance problems. The instructor is doing a fantastic job in making things clear to people from all background. ",5
1257,This course has been a great way for me to approach Machine Learning. ,5
1258,This is an excellent course to learn about different supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms with structured data. The explanations are clear and include advices of implementation and different examples. It is not needed any background knowleadge on machine learning to begin. ,5
1259,"Great class! It was recommended by a friend of mine, and due to the COVID-19 situation I decided to take it as it seemed to be a nice way to spend my days working from home. This class does not only teach you about the theory behind different machine learning applications, but also how to build your own systems, improve existing systems and where to look for when systems are not working as desired. I learned a lot from this course and I'm sure it will contribute to my current work as an engineer. Again, great job, to all people involved in providing this course!",5
1260,An absolutely wonderful introduction to Machine Learning.,5
1261,"The short answer is that I thought it was a very comprehensive intro to a fairly complex topic that focussed on the hows but also the whys of ML. Since it was put together before the advent of lots of different ML frameworks that do lots of the mathematical heavy lifting for you, there is more of a focus on math than some would like, but I personally think that in this field it is very useful to have some idea of what is going on ""under the hood"". I wrote a much longer review here: ",5
1262,"A great introduction to the field by a legendary instructor. A lot of effort has been put to build intuition in the fields covered, while using the minimal amount of linear algebra possible. Covers the just right amount of material (last 3 weeks may be a bit loosely related and tacked on, but I see why they were included.) Some purely mechanical concepts are left a bit hazy (hypothesis being Theta'*X in material but matlab code requiring a bit wrangling to get the proper matrix dimensions does not seem to be covered and I had to deal with using trial and error.)",5
1263,"Wonderful course !! I have been trying to gain practical machine learning algorithms but some online materials were too mathematical and others were too introductory. The hands on labs helped me gain the concrete understanding of concepts and confidence that I could build a simple ML system by my self in the future. Also, practical information during the class will save me tons of my hours if I will build any ML applications in the future. I really appreciated this class and it was a happy time. I really thank Prof. Ng with all my heart !!! Thank you very much..",5
1264,"Excellent! I got a degree in Machine Learning at UCL, and both during and after my studies I found clear explanations from Professor Andrew Ng when I most needed them. The course is designed this way: each thing taught by Andrew is tested, evaluated, so one can monitor his/her advance all the time. I myself am a teacher in my country, and think that this is the way a teacher should design his courses, creating resources to monitor the learning of the students on the go, all the time, with plenty of simple exercises together with few difficult projects and tests.",5
1265,Contents are carefully organized with good exercises.  ,5
1266,"A very well structured instructor lead course. The instructor was very thorough, and always willing to answer questions and clarify coursework, no matter how minor. The course described the theory of machine/deep learning well, but also followed through with very thorough examples to demonstrate the practical implementations of the theory. This lead nicely into the student exercises, which served to solidify the instructors teachings and encourage experimentation. The resources provided for students was exceptional, and presented in a very user friendly format.",5
1267,"Good introduction to the machine learning world. The course mostly focuses on supervised learning giving an intuitive journey throughout different core machine learning algorithms such as linear/logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, etc. Although the theoretical content as well as the programming assignments don't go much into detail, they are a good starting point from which different algorithms, techniques and mathematical frameworks can be further studied. All in all, it provides with a very good overview of what machine learning is.",5
1268,"Great course. Very well organized and explained. The practical exercises are also a great way to understand what was spoken in the videos and are not so hard that you spend a lot of time trying to find out what you're supposed to do. In fact, I learned a lot with them, as they are also quite explanatory and guide you through what you should be doing and why, and will for sure serve as future reference as I implement ML algorithms in my products. The course is very good and anyone with any background and level of knowledge in the area can take it and understand.",5
1269,"Thank you so much Professor Andrew Ng!!! This course is my first course learning Machine Learning and I thought the process would be extremely tough. After taking your course, I found that there exists interesting things solving practical problems using algorithms with coding though I still need to go over some parts that I could not absorb once. The next challenge for me will be programming the matlab tutorial into Python code and apply some to do some predictions! The learning process was enjoyable and I will take more related courses to strengthen my skill. ",5
1270,"First of all, it was a great class and highly recommend all the people as long as they can understand. It is not just learning a high technology knowledge but also knowing in which world we are living now searching Google, watching Netflix, listening Apple music, buying from Amazon and so on. As mentioned by Prof. Ng, it was  not easy for me to complete all the weeks as being in busy life with working, parenting and so on. I just learned what Machine Learning is and will continue to learn and apply this to my work. Prof. Ng's teaching is very impressive to me.",5
1271,"An excellent course ! All the complexity of calculus and algorithms is brilliantly broke down by Professor Andrew N.G., plus tons of tips ans intuitive explanations in order to grasp the general ideas. This course made Machine Learning accessible to a coding illiterate like me, I was even able to complete all the programmation exercises - which makes me think that those exercises were maybe a little too simplified. I would also have loved more explanation and guidance towards a first personal project. I will definitely look for the advanced class with Andrew !",5
1272,"Excellent training with a good mix between theory and practice. It is still a long way to building a  tool that can be used in an operational environment with a proper user interface, sufficient training data and high performance but it all starts with understanding the basics and I feel this training has given me that. I also appreciate that this training can be consumed for free so those that do not have the means can still learn and progress themselves. For me it was definitely worth the small fee requested for the certificate. Thanks to Andrew and Coursera",5
1273,The Course gives in depth knowledge on all the topics needed to kick start your career in machine learning. The lecture videos contains real life examples with all the mathematics behind the machine learning. This course can be completed using both Octave and Matlab (free license is provided till the duration of the course which is the best part). The Programming Exercise are also really helpful to understand the theoretical concepts. Thanks Andrew for the course. I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to start their career on machine learning.    ,5
1274,"Machine Learning by Andrew Ng has been one of the better courses I have done. The course is a good way to getting started with machine learning for people who know nothing about it. One thing I really liked about the course was that, Andrew emphasizes more on giving an intuition behind a concept, and then introduces the mathematical representation. This helps people without a strong mathematical background, a lot. I would like to thank Andrew for taking time to make these videos and lecture materials. Looking forward to a second version of the course from him!",5
1275,  1. Very helpful course for learning ABC of ML. If you complete this course you will find it very easy to follow in more advanced ML courses.2. Sometimes I found the course assignment over-hinted by the mentors. Without knowing deeply you can complete some tasks easily and quickly.3. Expected more programming assignments in last two weeks but last two weeks only have quizzes.4. More mathematical treatment was expected; but that was intentionally avoided by Andrew Ng for this course I guess.  ,5
1276,"Exceptionally well arranged, taught, and organized course. I had a lot of fun learning, ever more fun solving  quizzes and programming assignments. Prof Andrew Ng is a truly master in the craft of machine learning and an exceptionally gifted teacher, which is a rear combination and I as a participant of the course feel privileged to have been learning this fascinating area of science from him. As a follow-up to the course I wish I could make a real world machine learning application for a particular vertical, under guiding supervision of Prof Andrew Ng's team.",5
1277,"I really enjoyed the course. I had no initial knowledge in machine learning and felt that after completing the course that I could develop ML applications myself. Before taking the course, I already had a good understanding of linear algebra and Matlab which made the programming exercises easy. Although the programming exercises were easy, they were excellent and demonstrated how powerful machine learning can be using practical examples. The programming exercises often prompted ideas that drove me to go much beyond the class into developing ML code of my own.  ",5
1278,Excellent course that walked me through machine learning concepts right from the beginning. It does not require previous knowledge of machine learning or advanced math. The programming assignments in MATLAB / Octave are designed to be easy and beneficial. The code developed in those assignments can be readily used for real life machine learning problems. Dr. Andrew was an excellent teacher; with great ability to simply complicated concepts and present them in a way the student can intuitively understand them. It was a great pleasure for me to take the course.,5
1279,"I found the whole knowledge and the way it was presented (Coursera framework), very useful and even if I don't consider myself as an expert in this field, I was able to create some small projects for ML. Exercises are almost ready to use tools for simple projects as well (you can play with them, debug and etc.). Coursera framework was helpful as well to finish it without a stress - I had health problems during it and had to take a break for two weeks, but I've managed to catchup. Practical knowledge of Prof. Andrew Ng is the best part. Thanks for this course!",5
1280,A very good course !  At first I knew nothing about machine learning and now I know quite a lot. The course got me much more interested in machine learning. I find Professor Ng a great teacher. The pacing in the course is great and although I don't know much about linear algebra and calculus (which play a big role in the algorithms that are covered in the course) I could still complete the course. Everything is explained very well and in depth. I do think some programming experience would be helpful because I think that is what helped me a lot in this course. ,5
1281,"This course is extremely well organized with exciting video lectures and material. The quizzes confirm your understanding of important concepts and programming exercises provide hands on experience. Professor NG masterfully navigates complex ideas and breaks down machine learning processes into digestible pieces. He went well beyond academics using real world examples and spent much time introducing and reinforcing best practices. Lastly, the Coursera mentors provided useful advice and test cases to help students confirm accuracy of the programming exercises. ",5
1282,"It is an incredibly detailed course about this technology with a good balance between theory and practice. And without entering too much in the adiacent matters like math. And seems fair, if someone doesn't know the math behind this course can take a special course for math.",5
1283,"I have no background in machine learning algorithm, gradient descent and octave program at all. However Prof. Andrew will slowly take you step by step how statistics and programming makes machine learning a reality. Bear in mind, by the mid of the course, around neural network, course start heating up, and I had to spend hours after hours to completely understand and visualize the neural networks. Luckily, you can submit your course assignment later than the deadline. For anyone 1st step into machine learning world, this is the course for you. ",5
1284,"It is the best machine learning course for the people who want to become a data analysts and data scientists. The course is not like others that requires too much knowledge on mathematics, i.e. statistics and linear algebra. Andrew is good teacher and good at explaining the complicated topics like SVM and graident descent using pretty simple figures and illustrations. Finally, I really enjoy the programming exercies assigned in the course, which force us to understand the principles behind. Thanks Professor Andrew and thanks Coursera for the wonderful course!",5
1285,"I would like to thank Prof. Ng for the understandable introduction into Machine Learning World. I learned insights of several commonly used algorithms in ML. Several good hints and tips are really good for dealing in programming in real world. Totally agree with the approach to use Octave, as it focus on the math (and what is happening in the algorithm) rather than getting lost in the tool chains of programming. The intuition about what is happening (how it works) really stands out in comparison to other course available (for not getting lost in the wild...).",5
1286,Strengths:,5
1287,"This is an extraordinary machine learning class! When I was starting this course, I thought that I knew a lot about machine learning. I was wrong. This course taught me a huge amount and it showed me how big the world of machine learning really is. This class was also a pleasure to be in. It perfected the balance of challenge and guidance. The programming assignments were difficult but doable, and help was always available. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this class -- and it was time well spent, teaching me more than any book could.",5
1288,"I have truly enjoyed this online course from Andrew Ng and I was amazed by the sheer amount of material that was covered in only 11 weeks. I have previous experience with machine learning from doing a PhD at Newcastle University, UK. The golden nuggets for me was the algorithm diagnostics and evaluation steps to ensure that time and resources are spent correctly in order to avoid loss of time and resources.",5
1289,"I consider this course to be the best for an introduction in ML. Mr Ng is really trying to keep it simple and compact, concept explanation is ""user friendly"". ",5
1290,I really enjoyed the course and the level was just about right. The videos were enjoyable and not too long or short. The questions were very good and in most cases really challenged you to understand the material. The programming in MATLAB/Octave was fun but challenging for anyone who had not used it before even though in hindsight the few lines of code that needed to be written seemed so simple. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants a robust introduction into Machine Learning and who has a robust understanding of high school math and statistics.,5
1291,"Incredible and highly educational course, I have no criticism what so ever concerning professor Andrew nor the course itself. It opened new doors for me and provided a fresh view on this frequently discussed topic, which I knew little of, until I took this amazing course. I'm grateful for the lessons, helpful tips and practical work that was put into this course. This course surpassed all my expectations  and I want to recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn something new and interesting in the field of software engineering/computer science.",5
1292,"Great introductory course to a broad range of topics in ML. If you have completed basic engineering math courses, you will do just fine in this course. Do not be discouraged. Also, if you don't know how to program, you will learn little by little as you get through the assignments. Matlab/Octave is very easy to learn.One of my favorite topics was the Neural Networks, and Recommender Systems. Right away you can see the different applications you can use this for. Very happy, and looking forward to my next course which will most likely be from deeplearning.ai",5
1293,"This course give me a general conception of how machine learning works, can be regard as a basic course for people who work on machine learning, deep learning... ",5
1294,,5
1295,"This course is complex I needed to remeber very thing from University like: algebra, neural networks, equations, something that I now use very offten, but it 's very interesting all the informations, the class is very helpfull to undertand the topics and the Relationship with matemathic, algorithms and programming and undertand how it works some process like recommendation system, OCR, supervise and unsupervice training, visualization data, the good practice and advises. I need now create a project where I Can use all this information in my job or new job.",5
1296,"I would like to express my deepest gratitude and sincerest thanks to Prof. Andrew NG for opening the doors to the fascinating world of Machine Learning to me. This Machine Learning course is truly world class and my sincere thanks again to entire Coursera team to make it accessible to thousands and thousands of ML enthusiasts across the globe. The efforts of Prof. NG and Coursera in general to make knowledge accessible through a world class platform like this, will definitely make the world a better place! My best wishes for more success in this endeavour!",5
1297,What can I say....,5
1298,"This is the first course I've completed on Coursera, and it's not an exaggeration to say that this course has changed my future paths: the academic direction that I will pursuit in the near future, and the career options that has opened up to me.",5
1299,"This is the best course I've taken for a long time. It's very informative, useful and practical. It gave me (eager to learn but lacking technical knowledge) a door to open a door for all types of future opportunities. Mostly importantly, it's been a fun experience to know that many of the cool applications of of Machine Learning and solve the problems myself. I've been interested in the subject of machine learning and deep learning for a long time but only this course helped me understand the most advanced concepts or challenges at a whole different level.",5
1300,"A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning. This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques, concepts and best practices. If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist, this is your gateway. This course will leave you equipped and confident to get into the amazing world of Machine Learning. Professor Ng and his team has truly created a gem. I wish they would create and release the Deep Learning course, which delves into further models and topics currently very hot in the world of ML.",5
1301,"Andrew Ng, the lecturer, presented well-structured lectures with well-rounded knowledge of machine learning involving supervised learning, unsupervised learning as well as evaluation methods. This course is relatively easy to follow, and to some extent could further evoke my interest on this topic. Never knew exactly how machine learning was applied to face recognition, weather forecasting and many other technologies, and this course taught me all these implementation methods which is fascinating. Thank you for teaching and sharing these valuable topics .",5
1302,THE BEST!,5
1303,"The quality of this course is really astonishing. Never in my life had I though that it was possible to get University-Level courses taught by experts not only in such nice format and delivered by an amazing platform like Coursera but also for free (If you don't want to get a certificate). The course on only goes into detail about the math behind machine learning but the instructor (Andrew Ng) also makes hard concepts easy to understand, which is critical in order to apply them later on at the course as it also shows you how to apply what you have learnt.  ",5
1304,"Excellent course that lives up to its reputation as a great introduction to Machine Learning. You'll learn a lot of the relevant concepts via lectures and apply them through the quizzes and programming exercises. Basic programming knowledge would be helpful, but no deep statistical / computer science / linear algebra background is required to fully enjoy the course. I've taken formal Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence classes as a CS undergrad and still found this course to be very useful in both refreshing and learning concepts. Thank you Dr. Ng!",5
1305,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course! Working as a data scientist for ~3 years, I (as Andrew NG mentioned in one of the videos) had been implementing algorithms without the ground-level knowledge of how they function. Although I was aware of a lot of the implementations and effects of tuning parameters and ceiling analysis, etc. ",5
1306,"I've started this course after getting a lot of courses that had no benefit to me. I looked for a way to go around understanding the theory, and jump straight to application. Needless to say, that didn't work well for me. I could do what's instructed on these courses, but I lost myself midway.",5
1307,"Es un gran curso si quieres entrar a conocer machine learning. Tener algunas herramientas básicas de matemáticas como álgebra lineal básica, es decir, operaciones con matrices, y nociones sobre derivadas paricales es más que suficiente. Las explicaciones son claras y lo que más me gustó es la manera en que se realiza cada tara, en la que se te da una plantilla sobre la que tienes que ir programando, esta te va guiando en cuáles son las tareas a realizar y califica si hiciste bien cada caso. He probado otros cursos en linea y este me ha parecido el mejor. ",5
1308,"This is a great introduction to machine learning, and perhaps the best online course I've taken so far. I've tried to start many other online courses in the past, but this is the only one that made me motivated enough to finish! Professor Ng does a wonderful job distilling complicated subjects, and the coding assignments are hands-on without being overwhelming. Using the knowledge I gained in this course and some review of a previous data science course I'd taken in college, I was able to pivot in my career from working on consumer-based products to NLP. ",5
1309,Awesome class! Just two remarks:,5
1310,Very good course content and presented very well. This helps to give us a good understanding of how AI/ML works and consider potential areas of application. ,5
1311,"Andrew NG sir is an amazing teacher, the way he classified the syllabus of such an important and hard course and made every topic easier and shared great details of not only theory but also implementations, debugging techniques and advises on what & how to work on has been very helpful for complete beginners like me new to the field of machine learning.",5
1312,"A very complete course, given by a passionate, patient, pedagogue, - well in one word, excellent - professor! Thanks to this course, I now have a strong basis in Machine Learning, and a lot of areas to explore, and in the right way thanks to the multiple advices, so I would like to thank Professor Andrew Ng personnally! I totally recommend this course for anybody that wants to dive into this wide world and doesn't know how to tackle it. This also applies to people with a strong background in mathematics, and with a little knowledge in Machine Learning!",5
1313,"Being in Genetics/Computation biology domain myself, I found this course extremely useful. The coursework and concepts are very thorough and laid out perfectly well;  and at appropriate pace as well. I would revisit this course when I want to brush up my concepts. For working individuals and students alike, this course provides a foundation to shape their careers in ML. Lots to learn.. This has been a good start for me. Thanks Andrew, the staff and the volunteers for putting together this precious material available to everyone. A truly genuine effort! ",5
1314,"This is a challenging course of course, but it helps build a solid understanding of key machine learning algorithms. Walking out of class, I'm pretty comfortable with implementation of key linear, non-linear, and clustering algorithms. The class also discusses about how to evaluate a machine learning system, decide what to work on and improve as next steps. Overall, great learning experience for machine learning foundation. There is still way to go if you would like to learn about advanced topics, such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, and etc. ",5
1315,"The course gives very clear and easy-to-understand illustration of most of the essential concepts, methods and practical notes in machine learning. My disappointment would be it isn't really unpacking the mathematical process behind it. There is some engagement but still not sufficient. For example, I know how to get Delta and gradient using back propagation but still don't know how theta is mathematically updated after getting the Delta or the gradient. In general, I think it's very a good course for both beginners and those at the intermediate level.",5
1316,I started this course when I noticed that I was gradually getting used to taking care my baby and I had some spare time. The course is well designed with 10-15 minutes videos that were ideal to my situation. I liked practical advices from the course and programming assignments as I learned similar topic more theoretically when I was university students. And also it was nice the lecturer Andrew Ng motivate us to study such as saying people make bunch of money with machine learning technique :) Now I consider taking the deep learning course by Andrew Ng.,5
1317,Very interesting course :,5
1318,"Andrew reminds me of one of my professors at university,
teaching a complex subject like fluid dynamics. He was able to “effortlessly”, spontaneously, transfer his knowledge
to his students.",5
1319,"For a ML beginer I believe this course is by far the best. I've tried a few others before I decided on Andrew Ng's ML course. It turn out to be a wise choose.The course focus on main concepts, the exercises are absolutly well constructed. I also benefited fromt Mr. Ng's clear and simple language used  through out the course. Whoever take this course should first learn at least Linear Algebra! Be prepared to work on lot of vectorized operations using Octave. Don't be scared, Octave is actually very easy to learn for beginners!",5
1320,I just wanted to say thanks to Professor Ng and all the mentors and everyone involved in putting this course (and Coursera) together.,5
1321,The course was really awesome especially the instructor Andrew Ng takes you through each topic of machine learning. I completed this course in 2 weeks. Before taking this course I didn't know anything about ML. Looking back I can definitely say that this journey tough me a lot and I am very confident about my knowledge that i gain. The only con of this course is that it not tech you programming. You have to learn it from different resource. But don't get it wrong. This course is a real gem for understanding algorithms and insights of Machine Learning ,5
1322,"Fantastic course! Great balance of teaching content, quizzes and exercises. The content is deep enough that you gain a real understanding of the mechanics behind machine learning algorithms, without needing a statistics or computer science degree. ",5
1323,Great course. It taught me many new concepts about ML. The tips given by the prof on troubleshooting were also extremely helpful. ,5
1324,"The course is most useful for students not in the maths/engineering field. As a medical student with only high school maths and computing, I am happy to learn just enough to explore real problems in my field. It does not assume previous knowledge in advanced linear algebra, multivariable calculus and Matlab programming. I'm able to go through the whole course and finish the assignments in just 2 weeks. In contrast, I am unlikely to be able to go through the other online ML courses by famous universities or even the youtube version of Prof. Andrew Ng.",5
1325,"Great course! This really breaks down machine learning, and from day 1 has you learning practical information that you can use. The MATLAB exercises were great, and I particularly liked the number recognition problem. The simplicity is amazing, you just need to know how to organize your data, and apply the appropriate algorithms, and the opportunities are endless. After taking this, I feel ready to apply machine learning to anything and everything. Andrew does an excellent job of simplifying ML and showing you how to apply it to real world problems. ",5
1326,"This course though not advanced or in-depth, covered the basics and concepts well. Andrew Ng took the course at a nice pace which made it interesting and kept my attention from wavering, and the training was very well organized in a way that was easier to follow and understand.This was the first training I attended on Machine learning and after this course I am feeling pretty confident that I can master machine learning if I spend some time on it...and I am rating it 5 as it has given me this confidence to pursue Machine learning as a career option. ",5
1327,"I can only commend this course, the quizzes in the videos meant sure I was engaged and prepared for the tests at the end of each week. I was especially impressed by the coding tasks, with the automated marking providing instant feedback. The problems required a thorough comprehension of the material, providing challenge applying them to a variety of interesting examples. I found this style of teaching very helpful, and really appreciate the effort put into producing the course, it is of a standard on par, if not better than, all my previous studies.",5
1328,"I have some backgrounds in maths, physics and some programing skills. I followed this course in order to develop my professional skills, and to get a better insight into the topic.",5
1329,"It is pretty fast paced as well in depth course on Machine Learning. First five weeks are hard and mainly focused on building foundation while rest of the weeks teaches very useful technique to broaden the knowledge. Professor Ng has done awesome job as well as all the mentors. There is so much information on the group discussion, I hardly had to post anything as most of the answers to my questions are already there. wiki page is great and I did read it before taking any quiz. Some quizzes are super hard and I had to attempt few times to pass those.",5
1330,"In my opinion, this course is really neat and well prepared. It covers all the essential topics and the professor simplifies them as much as possible. I'm so grateful for those of whom have helped me in the discussion forum and of course the professor Andrew Ng. And also many many thanks to people who worked in Coursera who allow broke students like me to have an opportunity to have this kind of good education. Hopefully, this great course will help me to achieve my goals and find my dream job in this field and I will be able to pay for the course.",5
1331,"I am so glad that I chose this course to learn machine learning. It is a comprehensive course with intermediate programming exercise that really helps me understand more about the machine learning algorithms lying behind. Hope some day in the future as Professor Andrew Ng said, I could build some cool applications with machine learing techniques to make this world a better place. I am gonna miss Professor Andrew Ng's attractice voice and the scene when he turned back to his computer. Hope to see Professor Andrew Ng some other day in another course.",5
1332,"This is an amazing online course that leads you to step forward every week. I know nothing about machine learning before taking this course, but now I feel like the idea of machine learning has been firmly rooted in my mind. The quizzes and programming assignment are well-designed, help you go over the lectures, re-think and improve. I really appreciate Dr. Andrew Ng and many other people who have been working with the course development. Thank you so much for making this wonderful course open to public and impact the young generation of the world!",5
1333,"I totally recommend this course for everyone who are looking for a starting point in Machine Learning or AI. All the videos and lectures are really interesting and you would learn a lot with them. Thanks to professor Andrew Ng, we have a course of this high quality.",5
1334,"I would like to thank Andrew Ng! I was fascinated by Andrew's laconic teaching style and his clear explanation. He gave me so much inspiration for future learning and aspiration on the machine learning and AI fields. I am very pleased that I studied this course and I will definitely recommend it to all my colleagues and friends! To me, the course was unmatched and interesting, in fact, quite challenging even for a computer scientist. Andrew Ng seems to me the best ever teacher on linear algebra and optimization methods. Thank you very much, Andrew!",5
1335,"The best ML course I've ever seen. Though it doesn't go deep into fancy and new state of the art algorithms, it gives very good intuition about the field in general. More importantly, the course gives tremendously useful and universal advises about applications of any ML algorithms and building complex ML-based systems! If your goal is to start making a successful product as fast as possible - this is definitely the course for you. Even if you're already consider yourself a skillful ML specialist, I still recommend you to at least watch the videos.",5
1336,FIrst of all A BIG THANKS to COURSERA for providing me Financial aid and helping and standing for students like me who wants to learn  but  have financial problem to afford the course fees. I am very grateful to you .,5
1337,"In my humble opinion it was an exceptionally organized course, taught by an amazing and with a lot of knowledge instructor, with very well purposeful assignments and tangible real world examples in the context of machine learning science. Congratulations!",5
1338,"This was my first ever course on machine learning, and after completing it, I can definitely say that this course is one of the best ways to start your journey towards Machine Learning expertise. A very well structured course with well framed quizzes and assignments to get hands on experience along with great teachers solving doubts on discussion forums. You simply can not ask for more! I appreciate the efforts put in by professor Andrew Ng and the mentors helping students like me to sail forward through the course. The course is simply worth it!!",5
1339,"As a physician interested in machine learning and a lapsed engineer, this was a great introduction to the topic. I think Professor Ng's special talent is making such a complex topic approachable for beginners. As someone with basically zero programming experience, doing the programming exercises in a high level environment like Octave/Matlab was definitely helpful. If I had to do it in R or Python I would have probably given up, but now that I have coded the concepts in Octave I feel like I can implement it into another language relatively easily.",5
1340,"Excellent course in terms of explanations. However the exercises fall somewhat short on hard coding. Most of them are done after vectorizing some equations in MatLab and i would not be confident to develop for instance a neural network in MatLab from scratch after completing the ""supervised learning"" section. However i understand that there must be an infrastructure present such that the grader algorithm can access a single file. I believe this kind of method for graded assignments is the best that you can do without review from an actual  person. ",5
1341,"The most powerful course that provide a deep understanding not just for the different algorithms that are used in Machine learning, but it also gives you a great understanding about how and when you can use it.",5
1342,"Prof Andrew is a great teacher for me.,I do understand each topic in every week. I almost think that I can't pass through the eleven weeks of this course. Somehow I'm manage to complete all of the task. Of course I can't do this all by myself without the guidance that was been given from him and all mentors The knowledge about machine learning  which has been taught by him was a memorable experience and precious for me. Thank you for being a good teacher in this course! I hope to enroll your other course about machine learning field. in the future",5
1343,"This was a great class which helped me get a good foundation in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am very pleased with the math concepts that were explained throughout the course to help students truly understand the underlying work of some common machine learning algorithms. Although sometimes I felt like there was some information missing or somethings weren't very clear, there was always help available on the forums and good verbose tutorials as well. Thanks a lot Andrew Ng, Tom Mosher, and everyone who participated in the forums.",5
1344,Has been an amazing experience.,5
1345,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. Professor Ng is highly engaging and has a way of making even heavy subject matter accessible to those with a decent background in math. I found the course riveting and completed it weeks ahead of schedule, not because it wasn't challenging but because I was so interested that I began to use any spare time to hack away at the programming assignments or squeeze in a video or two. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about the fundamentals of machine learning and its applications.",5
1346,"This course is excellently organised. You will learn very interesting things about Machine Learning, but you will also work your programming skills (MATLAB/Octave). You don't need to know a lot of algebra or programming, although every knowledge is useful. Professor Andrew Ng is excellent and all the exercises are very well explained. Forums are VERY useful too, you will get help and feedback from teachers and other students very quickly. I completely recommend it to anyone in the engineering, computer science or even other scientific disciplines.",5
1347,"Excellent course for programmer engineer trying to start
with Machine Learning. Prof. Andrew beautifully abstracts the algorithms from
the mathematics, while leaving a clue for the inquisitive ones to explore. I
would suggest this course for anyone with some linear algebra and programming background
as a starter course to break into Machine Learning before trying to implement
the algorithms using other programming languages or tools. This course lays down
a very good foundation for learning advanced topics about Machine learning or
Deep learning. ",5
1348,"  Very good course for those who whats to get familiar with ML, and maybe dive a little deeper. The course provides quite comprehensive description of a number of main techniques used in the ML industry. Apart from everything else I have to give special recognition to two points. First, in all video lectures the audience can follow complicated arguments and calculations on the virtual whiteboard as the material presented. Second, each programming assignment is conveniently divided into logical parts so it is easy to submit and track one's progress.",5
1349,Thank you for sharing such an impressive training course!,5
1350,"Thank you prof Andrew Ng for such an enlightening course.  Although I do not feel like or consider myself an expert on Machine Learning, yet.  I felt I've been able to complete most of the course by trial and error on both the quizzes and assignments, without having a complete and in-depth understanding of the concepts taught.  Though I do intend to revisit the material another time, summarize the material by making notes, and further ingrain the taught material into my brain.",5
1351,"
  If you are interested in understanding how and why Machine Learning
 works, then check out this course.  I found it extremely helpful regarding 
the fundamentals as well as real-world implementations.  There are 
numerous optimization tips such as bias/variance trade-offs vs. 
feature/data set size that could save you countless hours.  The linear 
algebra review is informative for implementing efficient vectorized 
calculations, which are a critical part of the course programming 
exercises.  I'm looking forward to applying what I have learned.",5
1352,"Great basic but still comprehensive course to start or even gain more insight into machine learning. Strongly focused into practice and interpretation and not too focused into the underlying math, that makes it very suitable to people with background different than math/engineering/physics. One of the strongest and best addressed topic covered by this course is decision making regarding machine learning systems. Particularly, how to make decisions in a systematic and quantitative way in order to improve performance of a machine learning system. ",5
1353,"The course was taught superbly. All the doubts were addressed by prof Andrew by himself. It was a great exposure to machine learning. Great course to give good insights  of ML. Programming assignments focused on logical implementation rather than coding itself. The examples, where ever used, were very explanatory. Prof Andrew himself seems to have a lot of experience in Machine Learning and that reflects in the way he explains all the important concepts whenever it comes up.",5
1354,"What I have learnt throughout the duration of this course is significantly more than what I could not manage even having machine learning as a subject during my masters program. This right here was like relearning all over again but with a more hands-on approach with the best instructor I have ever come across and the best team of mentors to guide. It is just a suggestion, if the course is ever revised then please include at least an introduction to reinforcement learning so that we as learners have an iota of understanding regarding the topic.",5
1355,"By far that best hands-on ML material I have come across. Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher. He doesn't over complicate things, neither is the curriculum oversimplified. There is a nice balance of fundamental numerical computation and practical implementation details in this course. There is also put allot of effort into the exercises as well as lectures guiding the students intuition of the algorithms. Neural Networks in particular is extremely well explained and I can't wait to dive into the deep learning specialization also tough by Andrew Ng.",5
1356,"I  consider Professor Andrew Ng as eminence of Machine Learning teaching , I appreciated  the structure of the programming exercises: all is done to help the programmer focusing in the essential algorithm part along with all the detailed implementations, it is easy to realize that Mr Andrew Ng is perfectly aware of all the difficulties through which usually a beginner may get stuck and everything is done to easily overcome this! With Pr Andrew  all ML concepts are quickly and deeply understood, therefore this course is a must for all beginners!     ",5
1357,"As a german with a master's degree in computer science and engineering I came in contact with machine learning applications in my master thesis. To get a better insight in the topic, I enrolled in this course and really have to thank all that made the course possible. It gave me a better understanding of machine learning even though the course was a little bit too superficial and I would have liked a little more complexity here and there. Nonetheless I am glad that I spent my time on this course and look forward to my next course in this field.",5
1358,"Great place to start ML! I wish Numpy was used instead of Octave. I've heard people say this is an easy course. Well, when you think of exercises, the solutions are usually just a few lines of cod. But in my opinion, the challenge is to understand each concept so well that you can explain it to an ML neophyte.",5
1359,"It is a brilliant course meant for anyone starting out into the field of machine learning without any pre-requisite. Every topic is covered with such good information flow and practical examples to keep us engaged and interested. The resources are well-documented and programming assignments are well-prepared for anyone starting out with writing code could also complete them with learnings from the course. However, it would be highly beneficial if the programming assignments were changed to Python so that it is ready for production environment. ",5
1360,Perfect course for beginners in Machine Learning! Very well designed assignments(with starter code) to ensure that students spend time writing and evaluating algorithms(in a couple of hours) and see them in action and this remain hooked to the course. The amount of math touched upon the course is as minimal as needed to gain a practical insight into the working and intuition of various algorithms. I now understand why this is such a highly rated and most sought after beginner's course in ML. Enjoyed every single moment spent on this course. :),5
1361,"Since I graduated from University, I've been looking for ways to learn Machine Learning. I couldn't find a course  for months in my country that I could afford to, though. And after spending months searching for a course, three months ago I finally found this course. At first, I couldn't believe in my eyes. A Stanford course for free about my desirable subject? Without hesitation, I sign up to the course right away and I couldn't be happier for that decision. Thank you, Andrew Ng. and Stanford team for all your support. I really appreciate it.",5
1362,"Andrew Ng is brilliant at explaining complex machine learning algorithms in an intuitive fashion. The learning curve of the course feels just right, with the course ensuring you are up to speed with all the skills (e.g. matrix algebra) needed as it progresses - while remaining sufficiently challenging.",5
1363,"I was a little bit sceptical about the fact that the course contains so much theoretical material from a first glance. But after having worked through the weeks, I am very pleased with the programming exercises and the videos. The only drawback I can come up with is the quiz you have to complete each week (however, I do understand that it is an acceptable way to check your knowledge), with it's right/wrong questions. Andrew has made a great job teaching the class and I highly recommend it to anyone who is new to the field! ",5
1364,,5
1365,"머신 러닝을 이해할 수 있는 아주 좋은 강의였습니다. 비전공자 혹은 머신 러닝을 접해 보지 않은 사람들도 쉽게 강의를 들을 수 있을 것 같습니다. 반면에, 엄밀한 수학적 증명이나 모델, 데이터에 대한 디테일은 다루지 않는 경우가 많으므로 머신 러닝의 기초를 알거나 수학적 증명을 원하시는 분들은 부족함을 느낄 수도 있습니다.",5
1366,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, quizzes and programming exercises. After more than 30 years of teaching I was once again a student!",5
1367,"It was definitely a time consuming course, but like building blocks, the topics that we learned in week 1 are used in week 8 assignment. So watching the videos and taking notes along with the videos is a must to keep up with the course. The in depth but amazing explanation of the topics, makes it so easy to take notes and follow along. Any points that seem doubtful as you watch the video is instantly clarified by the instructor. Thus the instructor really does teach very clearly and explanations in very confusing parts are clarified properly.",5
1368,"I like how this course is both broad and deep, and equips me with practical skills to implement the (appropriate) algorithm to a real-world problem. I appreciate how Prof. Ng outlines ways to address and fix problems that might occur during implementation. I find the programming exercises extremely helpful and high quality. However, I wish that the course had optional videos of theoretical proofs for those who are fluent in multivariable calculus and linear algebra for deeper understanding. Lastly, thank you Prof. Ng and all the mentors! :-) ",5
1369,"This was a great course. I'm a Data Scientist by title and experience, but my hopes is to move into academics within this field. As a result, I am reviewing material to prepare for my masters degree that will hopefully lead to a PhD. I found this course a great refresher and highly recommend this course for anyone who's either new to machine learning or looking to review concepts they may have forgotten through time. Thank you, Andrew, for such a great course. Thanks to all who helped put this material out there for everyone to benefit from.",5
1370,"This is an excellent course to take. The material is just right, and the Professor is the best at this skills. He wouldn't miss a single detail you might have in the back of your mind when watching a lecture. I have a background is CS, and many of the topics are familiar to me, yet he connects the things from Linear Algebra, Statistics and CS in an amazing way. As a bonus, I'd say you might not expect in an academic course is Ceiling Analysis. It's simple but makes a lot of practical sense. It's something new to me. Again, great job. Thanks.",5
1371,It was my first course i`ve taken on machine learning.,5
1372,"Exceptional online course that stands out from over a dozen that I have taken.  Completion provided me with the tools and knowledge to immediately apply machine learning methods to my problems of interest, as well as a plethora of advice for dealing with practical issues and ensuring my time is efficiently used.  Also  as a result of this course I can now read machine learning technical papers with a much greater depth of understanding.  Thank you Dr. Ng.  I would highly recommend your course to anyone, including those already in the field. ",5
1373,"I just cannot imagine if an online course can be this great. Yes, it had lot of mathematics in it but a basic tech background would understand it easily. Even if you are not from tech then you can at least understand the essence and concepts of it. Thank you, professor! It felt like I am taking classes with one of my favourite professor from my MBA/MS times where I would just fold my hands and enjoy listening to the professor. The quizzes and the in-video questions were really helpful in solidifying my concepts and learning. Thanks again :) ",5
1374,"I highly recommend this course.  It covers various aspects of machine learning and is comprehensive for beginners. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. Lecture videos are interesting and easy to follow. Course is well structured. Now I can build machine learning models and I am super excited to apply for my research. I also became interested to learn more in this field and plan to take up courses in Deep learning on Coursera. Thank you teacher Andrew Ng for sharing your knowledge and expertise, and the Coursera for making the knowledge accessible.",5
1375,"I couldn't have asked for a better way to get introduced to machine learning. For me, the level of difficulty in terms of course content and programming assignments was optimal. It was just enough to challenge me and not too much to make me give up in between (although I did come close at times). Not to mention, the tutorial and help sections were really helpful to navigate the programming assignments. People contributing in those forum are the unsung heroes of sorts, working in the background and ensuring that the students don't get stuck.",5
1376,"It's been a little while since I've worked with linear algebra, so the linear-algebra-heavy beginning was rough, but once I got into the swing of things, the class was great. I learned much more than I expected in such a relatively short span of time. This was a great first step on the deep learning training path. Professor Ng is an excellent teacher and the mentors who generously volunteered their time on the forums were very helpful. I highly recommend going straight to the resources section if ever you struggle on any of the assignments.",5
1377,"The videos were clear and easy to follow.  The material mostly on the practical side with a good dose of intuitive reasoning, and a small amount of theoretical discussion.  The quizzes were designed so one continues learning even when being evaluated.  The programming exercises took a bit of effort, but the instructions provided a lot of guidance and helped you along.  Most important, Andrew Ng has a talent for teaching which comes through loud and clear in this course.  I highly recommend this course as an introduction to machine learning.  ",5
1378,"Andrew Ng does a very good job of explaining the concepts in detail as well as providing real-world examples in course assignments to help gain clearer insight.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the videos and working on the coursework, albeit I have a very weak-to-nonexistent coding background (and I know this is required to feel comfortable in this course) so assignments were much more challenging than they probably should have been.  Regardless, this is definitely an area I want to pursue more and that inspiration was fueled by this course.",5
1379,,5
1380,"This is an extremely good and thorough course. Andrew Ng is excellent at explaining complex concepts and the mathematics associated with it.  I found it invaluable that he was able to explain everything with a real-world context.  There is some programming involved in order to highlight some of the concepts,  but  the majority of the program is already written and you are tasked with completing the programs to underscore the learning.  Clearly a lot of time went into  creating this course and I thank Andrew Ng for creating and teaching it.",5
1381,"Having been in contact with different materials for the last year now that I was committed to finish this course I finally understood why so many of my collages recommend it. The overview it provides on not only algorithms, which I found important to understand what I was working with, but how to handle machine learning problems as well. Project/Problem evaluating tactics.",5
1382,"Prof. Andrew Ng has made machine learning a topic easy to grasp. With patience and hard work via his videos and the assignment, you will gain a lot of knowledge on Machine Learning.",5
1383,"Thank you professor Andrew. I've learnt a lot from this course. Before taking this course, I have no idea about anything of machine learning. But after that, I could tell that I'm pretty confident to build a real world machine learning system. This course gave me a strong foundation in machine learning. I believe I would learn more and more advanced algorithm based on the knowledge learnt from this class. Sorry for my poor English. But I wrote it by myself instead of spam software. Coursera will definitely recognize my comment as helpful:)",5
1384,"It's unbelievable that I can learn more sitting miles away than by sitting in an actual class. And the sole reason for that is the tremendous work Prof. Ng, the mentors and all others related to the course have put in in bringing this course online. Videos are extremely well explained and the programming assignments are just the right amount of challenging that leave a sense of satisfaction upon completion. It's a wonderful and unique attribute for a course to have its students attached to it. This one managed to achieve just that. Thanks!",5
1385,"An absolutely great course. The programming workload is reasonable----most of the time you only have to implement some of the core calculations and the instructions will walk you through it. Meanwhile, each exercise was given enough context that you'll be able to see the whole, comprehensive story and the visualization of your result. On the other hand, if you would like to write your own ML programs, you may want to come back and refer to the non-graded parts of the exercises (i.e. the parts of codes that were directly given to you) too.",5
1386,"Superb course for a starter in Machine Learning!! For someone like me who wanted to learn the basics of ML and its applications, this course proved to be the right choice. Now, I feel more confident to identify which business problems to solve and also know how to get business value out of it..",5
1387,"I just wanted to say, a big THANK YOU to Mr. Andrew Ng for making this course. It has been a dream for me to do something in AI/ML, and I feel lucky to start my journey from this course. Everything was so detailed, elaborate, and I got to learn so many fascination real-world applications of ML from this course, along with their implementation. After completing this course, I feel very proud and delighted. Now I can finally showcase my Machine Learning skills to the world. Finally, Mr. Andrew...You are a great teacher. May you live long!!!",5
1388,"This is really an awesome course, you can even start with this course directly after learning some basic concept of matrix operation, even the course is not in the python but how does the language matters when Andrew is explaining the algorithm in the way that you will be able to code in any language in which you are good at.",5
1389,"I decided to take this course moved by curiosity, and I didn't expect it to be so helpful for my work. However, Professor Andrewn Ng  exeeded my expectations, and the content of this course was not only interesting for my research, but it opened new ways in which machine learnig can be an useful tool for me. I am a young astrophysicist, and I could inmediately use the concepts of linear regression and neural networks to fit complex functions describing different states of the atom, and to classify automatically different kind of galaxies. ",5
1390,"This is a great course to give intuition about the major machine learning concepts. The course explains the mathematical background on an intermediate level that is just perfect to get one started on this track but not too much detailed so as to focus on the subject instead. The homeworks are very well planned and interesting, maybe a bit even too easy to complete, but lots of fun. Professor Ng is a great lecturer and I liked his style and presentations so much, that I will definitely take his other courses as well. Thank for the journey!",5
1391,"It is a tough but great course. You need your passion and determination to finish this course - the homework really took me a long time. Besides learning about machine learning, the course also provide me a new angle to refresh my understanding of calculus, linear algebra and programming language. Great experience! It also gives you a genuine sense of achievement when you finally finish the course after all the hard work. The course can't make you an expert, but it's a very good start for learning about machine learning. Highly recommend!",5
1392,"Excelente curso, tanto nos tópicos cobertos, como na abordagem e exposição dos temas. Combinando material e boa base teórica com exercícios práticos, atingiu completamente o objetivo de se ter uma visão ampla das principais e mais importantes técnicas de Machine Learning utilizadas no mercado. Recomendo a todos que desejem iniciar as atividades nessa área a partir da visão de um dos principais especialistas do setor (Andrew Ng), criando um sólido e embasado conhecimento para uso em aplicações práticas e futuros estudos e especializações.",5
1393,"This course does not only teaches you very useful and popular concepts, algorithms and techniques in machine learning, but also gives you a great intuition on how to use and apply that knowledge. Even without going much deep into the underlying math, it gives you a very solid foundation on the adressed subjects. Every lecture and exercise is very rounded up and carefully prepared, so I never got lost on anything. If it was a class in the real world, I don't think anyone would have to ask Andrew any questions in the middle of the lecture.",5
1394,"I did a ML course in Germany, and it was really hard and jumps straight into the deep end without explaining what the symbols in maths for those not coming straight out of a math course. This course is hard too, but Andrew Ng takes an approach that he explains every significant bit, states where one can skip over sections because he goes back to some basic math. Doesn't feel intimidating and really can see he's a sound guy just trying to teach what he knows in ML. Listen to what he has to say. Thank you for this chance to learn ML again.",5
1395,Great introduction to machine learning. The course structure is clear and it gives you the tools at hand you need for further education in this field. Thank you for sharing this course for free - I appreciated a lot.,5
1396,"First of all I would like to thank Sir Mr Andrew Ng for providing us a wonderful session. The way the course is planned is commendable. Looking forward to Learn more because I literally find myself Diving into knowledge and making my myself think more about myself and surrounding. At last but not the least I would like to thank the Coursera Organisation for allowing me in Enrolling this course. Truly I find myself in Imagining Things, Innovating Things and Inspiring People like you Sir.",5
1397,"Very well explained, instructor is very informative and knowledgeable. Programming exercises useful and enjoyable. Found it suitable for anyone who has at least GCSE Further Maths or A Level Maths. Only one mild frustration is the number of errata in the videos. These are, however clearly documented in the resources section, although it would be better if they were more visible when a video was being played. If you do the course, I would recommend correcting the errata in your notes as you go along, as doing it at the end is a big task. ",5
1398,"This was a very fun course! Andrew Ng sir explained the concepts really well, and I always found the lectures engaging throughout the course. The programming assignments were well designed to be in line with the lectures, though sometimes I felt that they were getting repetitive. The questions asked in between the lectures and the quizzes were also well thought out, making me recall the earlier concepts which were explained in class. Lecture slides and reading material were also available, but I personally didn't find much use for them.",5
1399,"Extremely useful for beginners to get a conceptual view of some key machine learning concepts. Andrew Ng's articulation is very clear, as can be expected. The Mentors are very helpful. Programming exercises could have been more challenging, but maybe there is a trade off somewhere. Decision trees, and some of the models recently in vogue (such as CNN) aren't covered at all. Also, this course is offered in Octave, which means there's another tool to learn (though not difficult at all). Python/R would've made it that much more accessible.",5
1400,"Excelente curso, bien estructurado, describe todos los conceptos necesarios para introducirse en machine learning y redes neuronales. Me gusta que se describan aplicaciones y que el curso contiene ejercicios reales para completar en matlab/octave. Lo recomiendo a todos los que se quieran iniciar en esta temática. Según el Profesor Ng, al terminar el curso nos podemos considerar expertos en Machine Learning! :-) Bromas a parte este curso nos da una muy buena idea de todo el potencial que tienen las herramientas de aprendizaje automático.",5
1401,"Throughout this class, I learned the most effective machine learning techniques, including both supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). I also gained experience on how to improve the machine learning algorithm with bias/variance theory, etc. Not only did I study lots of theories , I also carried them through MATLAB. I do believe you will learn a lot from this course.",5
1402,"Extremely helpful , It might be helpful to add a part in your homework section to help students control the flow of the task at hand , although the method used in the course is great for all kind of students , but it could be helpful to have an additional part for the more enthusiastic ones that want to test themselves in a platform like this with more freedom.",5
1403,"I was not expecting to learn GNU Octave in addition to the machine learning concepts.  I was a little surprised about this, but I understand now why Octave was selected - it was easy to learn and easy to visualize its application to the machine learning concepts.  The machine learning concepts and how to apply them to data were clearly explained.  It was a perfect balance of introductory theory and practice.  It will be easy for anyone going through the class to do additional research on the topics and increase their knowledge.  Thanks ",5
1404,"I've literally just finished the first week of the course in a few hours. Not because I rushed through, or had foreknowledge of the subject, in fact I had zero knowledge of the material, including some of the math involved. I missed one question on the quiz at the end, on my first try. I have never been more excited to learn, and am so glad I gave this a try. It seems scary at first to someone completely knew, but that feeling is long gone already. I am extremely thankful to Andrew Ng and Stanford for this amazing opportunity to learn!",5
1405,"I finished this course July of 2016, not sure why I am just commenting now. In any case, for those looking to get into the field of machine learning/data science, or those who are in a quantitative discipline looking to bolster their skill set, this course is invaluable. Dr. Ng is incredibly thorough with each concept and provides numerous examples to illustrate his points. His lecture notes may be a little hard to follow if you don't meet certain prerequisites (calculus, linear algebra, etc) but they're well worth the read regardless.",5
1406,"This course introduced some basic knowledge for machine learning. Although It doesn't go into very deep theoretical level, the content is sufficient for the engineering student. I'm a first grade master student in machine learning, and this course did teach me a lot about how to use the models and how to debug them. I think it would be enough content for master or potential PhD students if combining this course (for application) with CS224D in Stanford (for theory).",5
1407,"thanks for Andrew Ng that give me a clear slight about machine learning, and through this course I gain a well achievement, the knowledge taught by professor Ng shows a wisdom way to me. I think I will inspired much by the content of this course when I design a machine learning system or deep learning system.thank you for your concretely and clearly guidance that makes me insist to learning this course until end.you are the best teacher I have never met before, the implicit way that you teach makes me want to be a better man likes you.",5
1408,"It was a good, highly productive course. It describes very basics of machine learning, showing how it works on atomic level. Andrew Ng is a talented professor, and it was a pleasure to listen to his lectures. It takes time to get acquainted with Octave/MATLAB language if one mainly works ML on python. But I see that it takes away many things that rise in front of the beginners. I highly recommend this course even if one, like me, spent some time in ML, but lacked a solid theoretical foundation to move onto something much more complex.",5
1409,"Happy to get the Machine Learning certificate and to have learned about its overall concepts and applications throughout these 11 weeks. Covering supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as showing the best practices in the industry, this course is highly recommended because not only it explains the theory and the maths behind the algorithms, but it also helps you put everything in practice through the programming assignments. Thank you, Professor Andrew Ng, and looking forward to getting into the Deep Learning specialization! :)  ",5
1410,"This is a fantastic course. I take quite a few online courses but this is the first one that really took me back to my university days and felt like spending time really immersing oneself in the theory and practice of a truly fascinating area, and going on a journey with a man of knowledge and humility like Andrew. I'm many years out of university now so found some of the mathematical side difficult to come to terms with initially but it all came back in the end and I feel all the better for slogging through it. I'm sure you will too.",5
1411,"Awesome course for someone who is interested in this subject. The explanation by Andrew is extremely  clear and crisp. As long as you have some some background in linear algebra and statistics,  the course is fun to learn. The exercises are a combination of easy and difficult, but the tutorials and test cases help a lot to verify your working. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend any one interested in this subject. Just put sincere effort  in this course before embarking on other courses or reading material.",5
1412,"Awesome course!! It is the first time that I've suceeded in completing a course. I usually give up at the second week because many courses aren't useful, but this course is very very very useful and I've enjoyed it so much. It is really well structured and explained. In my opinion, the best feature of the course are the programming exercises that let you apply the concepts learned during the video lessons. The course is of huge quality especially the programming exercises that are explained in detail.",5
1413,"A very practical intermediate level course. Yet, it is ideal for beginners in machine learning also and I am saying this because the way the programming assignments are structured students does not have to write the code from scratch they only have to focus on the beef of the code and the trivial but insightful parts are already provided. Other than this lots and lots of hints are provided in theory and forums. So it is easy even for the beginners to successfully complete the course. Thank you, Andrew and forum mentors, Tom and Neil. ",5
1414,"I've not finished this course yet (almost done!) but already find it very useful. I myself am a maths freak and very enthusiastic about the course materials, but strongly believe the course is well-presented for ordinary learners as well. The materials are structured properly, paced and built up gradually with adequate amount of examples so the learners can efficiently assimilate. I like Andrew's method of teaching and believe he's perfectly well-suited for teaching this course. I strongly recommend this course to whoever interested.",5
1415,"This course is really really helpful. I would love to get some more advanced stuff after completing this course. My University lecturers are also following this course and the assignments of this courses. They also told us to completely follow this course as it is really productive. But at some stages I think some lessons are not that good. For example - SVM part is not that clear to me. At first I thought, it is just me but my friends also told that this part is not clear to them also. But overall, I am loving this course. Good job! ",5
1416,The teacher is good: can explain the knowledge well with simple words and without complex info.,5
1417,"Excellent course. Well-organised, clearly explained, with very illustrative programming exercises. Definitely a must-have for anyone seriously looking for learning about Machine Learning. ",5
1418,"Best Course on machine learning. I joined this course as a beginner had less confident in machine learning field but after this course I gained much confident in this field. About this course it's not only based on learning different algorithms but provide you real world scenario how to apply machine learning on your problems. How you can do it better, as Sir Andrew ng sharing his experience a lot of time and also giving other engineer's examples, so it's much beneficial for us to learn from their experience.",5
1419,"This class is amazing! Well-structured topics, well-explained, assignments covered to put in practice the knowledge you learn during the class. The professor seriously put too much effort to teach globally and giving motivation to the people taking the course to self-learn more, an example that education at own pace is possible and it could be also fun! ",5
1420,"This course was organized and well-taught.  There was a plethora of forum and tutorial info to help during the more challenging parts of the course.  My only wish is that it went slightly more into the details of how some of these algorithms work.  I feel like I scratched the surface, but I feel that to effectively implement some of these ML concepts, I'd need to dive slightly more into the details of when they work, when they fail and which algorithms to use when.  Overall, many thanks to Andrew Ng for putting this course together.",5
1421,"I found it very amusing that all important concepts in machine learning can be explained by basic mathematics of minimising error function. Every algorithm from linear regression, logistic regression to neural networks all rely on the same fundamental concept. It is very clearly explained by Prof. Andrew Ng. He also covers different tips and tricks on different problems which are currently faced within the industry. All these makes you feel that you are not only learning theoretical concepts but also practical sides to the problems.",5
1422,"Thank you, Mr. Andrew Ng.",5
1423,I would highly recommend this course to a person who is planning to get started in Machine Learning.. Course material is very easy to understand because of instructor of course... nicely taught..  Just a high school level knowledge of linear algebra and matrix is required.,5
1424,"I really enjoyed this course and I greatly appreciated the didactical approach of Prof. Ng and the passion that he puts into teaching. In particular, I've found extremely useful the practical advices that he gives throughout the lectures: they really add something to the theory, especially coming from such an expert. The programming exercises have been really nice to carry out, thanks to the detailed guiding lines in the exercise sheets. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested, or simply curious about the topic.",5
1425,"This is a great course to give you a detailed overview of the ""behind the libraries"" view of how particular learning algorithms work.  The course also covers a wide variety of scenarios on how to choose machine learning algorithms, their limits, and how to tune them both from the perspective of accuracy and efficiency.  The course took quite a lot of time and I am glad I already had a background in Matlab but it was well worth it.  I have been wanting to complete this course for a while and I think it was well worth the time spent.",5
1426,"The course was great! Though it was hard, some of the assignments took me a lot of time to properly debug and get them to work in the beginning, but I'm glad I was given them because it helped me properly shape on how to think about the problems in the first place. I wish we could use Python or R instead of Octave / Matlab. I don't really see many people using Octave in the industry, and using Python/R would contribute to my programming skills a bit more.But, still, the course was a nice introduction. I'm glad I was a part of this!",5
1427,"I found this course especially compelling and interesting as lots of mathematical concepts are covered from programmatic point of view. There are practical examples too, which help to understand usage of concepts. Andrew's presentation with sketched narratives anticipates your questions as if you are in the classroom, and just helps to digest the course material at the right pace. Although I must admit you should at least have some mathematical background, or else commit yourself to hard work right from the beginning of your study.",5
1428,This is my first course on coursera. Andrew Ng Sir is just awesome. This course gives you a clear intuition about how different machine learning algorithms work and the math involved behind it. The concepts are explained very clearly and now I have a good understanding how these algorithms work and how to use them. If you wish to start your career in Machine Learning then this course would be a great start.,5
1429,"Thanks for Mr Ng. I didn't know about machine learning before. Fortunately, this course is accessible for new bee. ",5
1430,"This is the best course of Machine Learning if you are a beginner. It starts from very basics and by the end of the course you will learn so many intuitions and approach of solving real life machine learning problem. The only point i felt should be improved is that all the assignment and algorithms have been explained and have to complete in MATLAB, but today most of the job that are related to ML are asking for experience in Python or R. So if the course could be modified in either of them, it would be a blessing for the learners.",5
1431,"I think that Professor Andrew NG is one of the greatest teacher i've seen entire my life. He really simplified relatively complex subjects and make them very enjoyable for me. And he provided very critical hints and tips for me to continue my studies in this topic. Questions, quiz and assigments in this class took quite a bit time for me but i think that they shaped me in a good way and now i think myself somewhat professional in related topic, thank you very much Professor and everyone who made their contributions for this class.",5
1432,"It is a lot of effort to put together such a class in online format, even though it existed on the lecture room floor. My heartfelt thanks to you, Dr. Ng, and all the TAs who helped to make it happen; the time you spent on it is a multiple of what each student put in. I think that every teacher learns something from their students. Even though there is no direct interaction across this platform, I hope organizing your thoughts in a concise manner that you exhibited throughout the class has also made you better in machine learning.",5
1433,"After a long time, I have seen a course like this. I enjoyed every quiz and assignments in the course. ",5
1434,"Despues de haber cursado machine learning, he comprendido mas a fondo como los algoritmos de aprendizaje automatico funcionan, las ventajas y desventajas y como identificar los principales errores, creo es el rumbo que tomare en la vida, por que ahora cobra sentido almacenar gran cantidad de datos, filtrarlos y extraer el valor de la informacion. Muchas gracias profe por la dedicacion y espero que todos los que cursemos estos cursos, en algun punto nos veamos en la vida practica y nos apoyemos como grandes ingenieros que somos :)",5
1435,"Thank you very much, Professor Andrew Ng! Initially, I was afraid that I could not do well in this course, but just after watching several videos, I totally changed my mind. I find that this course is of so great structure that I seldom feel confused. Not only can the videos and notes give me interesting knowledge, but the programming homework can also help me go even further. I know it's Professor's considerateness that make us not  struggle in programming, so thank you again for offering us such a memorable learning experience.",5
1436,"I took up these course just because ""Machine Learning"" is a buzz word but now after 11 weeks can definitely say this is one of the best things that could have happened to me, opened an entire new world to me, gave me great skills and Andrew Ng is by far the best I have encountered so-far great conceptual clarity, fantastic intuitions and Programming assignments were just icing on the curve to actually get a feel of the algorithm. Trust me ,you will have a steep learning curve and will enjoy the course to the fullest just as I did",5
1437,"This is an excellent course. I knew virtually nothing about machine learning prior to doing this course, and now I feel I have a good understanding of the various models and their underlying assumptions, applications and limitations. Prof. Andrew Ng is a superb teacher - a leader in his field who is prepared to take the time to carefully and patiently explain the ML concepts in detail but with an eye to their practical application. I am most grateful to him and his team for taking the time to put together such a wonderful course.",5
1438,Excellent course with practical and fun examples. I'm eager to try some of it at work !,5
1439,"Excelente curso, muy bien estructurado, con excelente herramientas instruccionales. El manejo del tema del instructor impecable, de mucho nivel, incluyente, estimulante a seguir estudiando. El instructor maneja un discurso inspirador que es fascinante y quiero felicitarlo por: conocimiento, manejo del tema, manejo de las herramientas instruccionales y sobre todo por sentir amor por lo que hace. Desde el tercer mundo, donde hay limitaciones para el acceso a este tipo de cursos le agradecemos a todos en especial al prof Andrew Ng.",5
1440,"Excellent course. I know that there is much more in the field and I do not recognize myself as an expert, nevertheless I now understand basic principles how this magic AI works and maybe I will even use it in my future career. By the way, when I enrolled to the course I thought this is perfect opportunity for change in career - after completing it I feel that what I do is similarly interesting (I am working in data management/business intelligence area, so my task is ""prepare and consolidate"" data - also for machine learning :))",5
1441,"This is a mind blowing course! Everyone knows Andrew Ng. Well organized, clearly explained, prompt and proper exercises (not too much or too little), sufficient amount of underlying mechanisms introduced (well balanced between theory and application, slightly towards the theory and mechanism) I am a biostatistician and seeking some breakthrough in my career, and am so lucky to find this killer course. But I do feel like basic programming and math/statistics knowledge is required. I would strongly recommend this course to ANYONE!",5
1442,"One of the most amazing online courses for machine learning, totally worth investing time to understand concepts of machine learning deeply and this course even teaches you the practical implementation techniques, warnings and advices. Really grateful to Prof. Andrew for teaching this course with such a detail and clarity that even complex algos were so easy to understand. This course really builds the strong base for Machine Learning, I encourage everyone who wants to learn machine learning from scratch should take this course.",5
1443,A course i always dreamed of doing . Excellent cool and slow paced teaching by Andrew. A super cool teacher and often emphasized on the key points throughout the course. I am from am Mechanical Engineering background and have never learnt any algorithms in my college days.  Thanks Andrew for keeping me motivated every week of the course and it has been a great journey always an excitement to listen to your speech and understanding all the algorithms.  I would love to say a BIG THANKS in my mother tongue TAMIL too.. மிக்க நன்றி ! ,5
1444,"I was surprised by the amount I ended up learning from this course. While the course may seem a bit easy, this is a result of Professor Ng's clear and concise teaching style. This course will give you a strong foundation in machine learning — enough for you to begin to self-teach yourself new algorithms and techniques with ease, and even allow you to parse through academic papers! I am left with an accomplished feeling, and slight sadness over the fact that I will never be able to take a full university course with Professor Ng.",5
1445,"Great course! Easy to follow, useful, and very practical. At the same time, if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and/or the math behind it, the lectures give you good directions to look further into it. The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side (in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you), but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting, and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth. Really glad I put the time into it. Totally worth it. ",5
1446,"Excellent course! In the first weeks, when the course started out with linear regression, I was very skeptical whether I would learn anything non-trivial here. But then I was very impressed how professor Ng managed to introduce Neural Networks until week 5 in a very clear manner. A great teacher gives you the feeling that what you are learning is easy although it is not. Great job! The only point of criticism I have is that the programming assignements are not quite hard enough to solve, but it is still a 5-star course for sure!",5
1447,"Spectacular! I am a systems engineer graduated in the early 80's, who worked only minimal time in developing systems afterwards. Fast forward almost 40 years later doing business, I found myself extremely immersed and fascinated with this topic of Machine Learning. I might even consider making a new career in this. Congratulations Andrew for this wonderful program and thank you for the experience!!",5
1448,I have tried numerous online ML courses before and never got to understand the topics. The online courses I attended focused more on application of ML and the programming language used rather than spending time explaining the concepts. The level of confidence I have after this class has increased. The facilitator has passion in explaining the topics covered in this course. I am grateful to partake in this class and will look for more ML related classes presented by the university particularly facilitated by Andrew Ng. Thank you ,5
1449,"One of the best classes that I've ever been in. It's been an honor being taught by Professor Andrew Ng in this amazing, comprehensive, easy to understand, and fun course. Being a 17 year old, I was surprisingly able to cope up with every segment of the course, like the programming assignments and quizzes. The course may have been a little mentally strenuous at times, and often quite challenging, but it's definitely an amazing way to learn one of the most up-and-coming areas of study. Thank you Andrew Ng, Coursera, and Stanford.",5
1450,"Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng. My search for a course to get my feet wet in machine learning came to an end here. The course is very well designed and gives an overall idea of concepts needed to understand the basics of machine learning concepts. I liked the way he builds the concepts in steps and highlighting only the needed mathematical aspects.   I wish Python could have been used as the programming language, however it is not a big hurdle on the way to learn the concepts. Once again thanks to the great efforts by professor.",5
1451,"I really recommend this course for anyone who is interested in understanding Machine Learning. The teacher is excellent, he covers the most relevant concepts of this topic at a sufficiently deep level to grasp what ML is all about. The programming exercises are great as well, they offer a  valuable way to visualize and understand the theory in practical real life examples. The reference material and the tutors' guidance is also outstanding, I consider that their help are essential to make it succesfuly to the end of the course. ",5
1452,"The course provided an outstanding balance of theory, practical advice, and the opportunity to practice (via the programming excercises).  The frequent quiz helped me stay focused on the lecture content and think through the material as it was being presented.  The lecturer was enthusiastic, extremely knowledgable and had a very pragmatic way of approaching the topic.  I am very grateful for having the opportunity to take this course, and would like to thank Andrew Ng, Coursera and Stanford for making it available to the public",5
1453,"I would give this class six stars if I could.   Dr. Ng's care for students is displayed in the course design, class presentation and homework assignment design.  Dr. Ng's crystal clear thought process is demonstrated in every word he says.  Only wish this course could be longer than it is and Dr. Ng could make time to have more online classes.  Thank you, Dr. Ng.   Thanks also to the mentors for this class who are incredibly prompt in answering questions.   The Forum is so active that it forms a part of the learning experience.",5
1454,"A fantastic course! Right pace, great selection of topics and excellent way to structure the material. It felt like reading Einstein's papers on Brownian motion -- professor Ng makes you feel like a genius. Given how much theory there is out there about machine learning, the approach of this class to include code-based exercises is tremendously helpful. The course materials, especially the tutorials and test cases for the programming exercises are very helpful. Course mentor Tom Mosher's contributions are particularly valuable. ",5
1455,Excellent material.,5
1456,"The instruction was helpful. There was enough rigorous derivation for context, but the focus was on the practical use of machine learning techniques. The exercises were excellent. They included simple, principled examples that demonstrated the fundamental concepts, as well as realistic applications that demonstrated their usefulness. There was also solid support from mentors. I would highly recommend this course. It's my first time using Coursera, and I plan to enroll in another class as soon as I'm done with this one. Thanks.",5
1457,Is one of the best courses I have ever took by a great teacher! Andew is really amazing on getting you step by step through the world of ML. I spent quite some time to learn ML,5
1458,Machine learning was like a really big deal as it had been projected in many of the forums i have visited till now. But after going through this course am pretty sure that it's as easy as writing a code in C/python.,5
1459,"very comprehensive and detailed class not only allows the beginners to get a good glance of the vast universe of the Machine learning and artificial intelligence but also showed them all the required knowledge to start applying machine learning to solve practical problems. I particularly appreciate the time and effort of all the relevant staff and Andrew spent on building the best exercise system I've ever seen, even compared with the universities' course work. very valuable course, and most importantly it is completely free.",5
1460,"I really enjoyed enrolling into this Machine Learning Course, especially because I had long wanted to be in an Andrew Ng's class!",5
1461,"Meticulously prepared lectures  give a very good in-depth knowledge of many fundamental topics in machine learning. In spite of the heavy weightage of the contents, the videos are short and rigorous so it saves the student from being bored. I really enjoyed the programming assignments and I believe it has made this course highly effective. ",5
1462,"Without any other knowledge of machine learning out of this course, I am fully satisfied with the content and the format of the course. It is easy-going and very understandable with the right mathematical background and matlab/octave experience. The assigments are guided enough to skip starting programming from the scratch, but at the same time offers practical hands-on machine learning real and powerful examples. It has provided me a set of skills I can truly implement to solve usual engineering problems I deal with at work. ",5
1463,"This is a very nice course for someone starting with machine learning. Andrew ng's teaching style is very good and he makes even very complex looking algorithms(mathematical equations) very simple to understand. Though this course takes little(not too little) about maths behind the algorithms but I would still recommend this course if you want to keep your learning curve smooth. Also apart from core concepts of machine learning, Andrew Ng gives ample advice/examples of applying these concepts efficiently in real life problems",5
1464,First of all sorry for my English. ,5
1465,"It was an absolute delight to go through this course and I really appreciate the effort to ensure the absence of any sort of ambiguity both in the lectures and in the assignments. Also, this platform is really amazing to provide courses like these free of cost and make knowledge accessible to everyone. I think that the math behind all these algorithms could have been explained in greater detail and made optional just for the curious ones, but I guess it was not meant to be a part of this course. So, thanks and keep it up! :)",5
1466,"Excelente curso que aporta las bases teóricas y matemáticas para empezar en el campo de la inteligencias artificial. La licencia de matlab proporcionada para la plataforma online fue algo excelente y los ejercicios son muy buenos. Tal vez Matlab no es lenguaje más usado para Machine Learning actualmente pero con estos conocimientos es posible llevarlos a otros lenguajes. Totalmente recomendado ya que no solo consiste en aplicar algoritmos, sino que lso consejos sobre pipelines y decisiones sobre tus modelos son muy valiosos.",5
1467,"This is the first and best online course I've ever taken. I can easily understand most of the topics without further after class research, based on a little of my related research experience of machine learning. This course helped me go over the knowledge I've learned before with more intuitive instructions. I'm planning to learn more on this fascinating area of machine learning/AI later on! I'm sure it will help more career without a doubt! Thank you Andrew  and all the staffs who have been contributed on making the course.",5
1468,"This course was absolutely excellent. Thank you very much professor Ng and the TAs such as Tim Mosher. The material, presentation, homeworks and everything was just right for me. In particular the homeworks were well laid out, the intricacies of data collection and wrangling were taken care of and the test cases were very useful. Did I forget to mention that the TAs and forums were extremely helpful? I learned tons and there was very little in terms of extraneous material or work. Simply excellent. I cannot thank you enough.",5
1469,"Its been 7 years since I've finished my undergraduate degree at Cal (Go Bears :D) but this is probably the most interesting class I've taken in my life. I hope I have the honor of meeting you one day Prof. Ng and at that stage, hopefully my startup, Eureka Investment has used machine learning to bridge the gap between efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance. Its my answer to our current theoretical and applied finance gap and I plan on proving it through application. Thanks again for a wonderful lesson.",5
1470,"This course was a great introduction to machine learning (ML). Besides the ML concepts and methods, the course explained the necessary mathematical and statistical concepts in a clear and simple manner. I believe people who have not done much maths or stats should be able to follow the materials. ML concepts were explained in a clear fashion with relevant examples and a good level of depth.",5
1471,,5
1472,"It is a perfect mix of the technical stuff (i.e. algorithms, formulas) and insights on applied machine learning. The latter is equally if not even more important because it ensures that you don't only know the algorithms and all, but you also know how to use them and use them right. Andrew Ng, without a doubt, is very knowledgeable on the topic and is an excellent instructor. Him telling you what areas to focus on or not and what you actually need makes learning a lot easier. I'd be glad to attend his other related classes.",5
1473,"This course is the best course for learning machine learning according my point of view. The lecturer,Mr.Andrew Ng is truly a  master of this subject. His explanations are very clear and easy to understand. I really like the fact that he doesn't only focus on the individuals who has a good knowledge in the subject but also the beginners like myself. Thanks to his awesome lecture series now I have a very good knowledge in machine learning. If any one has an intention to learn machine learning I highly recommends this course.",5
1474,"Great course to get introduced to the workings of machine learning. I understand much better now what machine learning is about, what it can do and how you can get it do to it for you. The programming exercises were very worthwhile, as they force you to really think about what you're doing and why. At times they were also quite frustrating, some have taken me considerably longer than the 3 hours that is listed for them. I can really recommend this course, but only to people who aren't afraid of numbers, math or programming.",5
1475,"This has been an excellent course. The videos were straight forward and provided excellent teaching and guidance. The programming was challenging and direct towards the learning objectives (gladly the programming did not waste time on the difficult setup of ML problems which could prove frustrating when that is not the current goal). Finally, Andrew Ng did an excellent job teaching in the videos. They were direct, interesting, and relevant. I do feel this provided an excellent foundation to ML and the tools to implement it. ",5
1476,"This is a fantastic course. All the topics are explained in very intelligible and accessible way for beginners. I am a software developer but I started the course with very small and limited knowledge about machine learning. Knowing virtually nothing I was guided through the lectures and exercises to arrive at the position were I have a pretty good idea about the topic and were I intend to review lecture notes and exercises once more to deepen my understanding even more. It's been fun and very informative course, thank you.",5
1477,"Amazing course. Loved the material and the way they were taught. Very interesting applications of machine learning in the assignments. Just try implementing the algorithms first by watching the videos so that you get a better understanding of how they work. It is possible to complete the assignments without much understanding, so make sure you implement the algorithms on your own first. All in all I loved the course, even made me thinking about pursuing a career in data science and machine learning. Thank you mr. Andrew Ng!",5
1478,"It has been a wonderful experience. A brilliant course,  I get quite fascinated by all the quiz and programming assignments. This course not just provided me with knowledge but also gave me a perspective to work on machine learning by teaching me all it's practical application and how i can utilise that knowledge as my contribution to the betterment of this world. Thank you Coursera and Andrew sir for putting this great opportunity  forward for us. Really looking forward to work on real world problems using this knowledge.",5
1479,"This is one of the best machine learning course available, even right now in 2020, period.",5
1480,"This course covers a lot of content, including all of basic concepts in Machine Learning. I fully enjoyed going through this course. The difficulty level is, I would say, easy to medium. The programming exercises are tougher than the quizzes, but the comments do give you a really good idea of how to write things in Matlab. Also, with experience in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and statistics, the course material really proves how applicable these math concepts are in the real world. Thank you Professor Andrew Ng.",5
1481,I've followed many free Machine Learning courses and also a paid one but I've always get stuck in the middle because lots of math and linear algebra was left in order to explain more algorithms and also because of the use of Python libraries that were too advanced for me even if I'm a Computer Science student. I found in this course the right balance between math(in particular linear algebra and probability) and programming(especially without the use of prebuilt libraries) and therefore this is a course worth of your time,5
1482,"I really liked this course! In my opinion, Prof Ng's lectures give just the right amount of mathematical background knowledge and practical examples to understand key topics and mechanics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms without going into keywords and packages like other similar courses I completed. Matlab programming exercises are well thought through and aimed to check conceptual understanding (and I wished there were more of them!). Highly recommend this SU Machine Learning online course to everyone.",5
1483,"Excellent course, by far the best I have encountered on Coursera. The content is explained brilliantly and the assignments are designed to ensure that students get hands-on experience implementing what is taught in class. The pace of the class is easy to follow and assignments are well instructed and easy to navigate. Prof Andrew Ng not only teaches machine learning but also how to apply it to practical and real life applications. At the end of the course I feel well equipped to start working on Machine Learning projects. ",5
1484,"Machine Learning course offered by Stanford university on coursera is best course on ML out there. Every fundamentals of the machine learning is covered in the course by Prof. Andrew ng ,perfectly crafted in weekly modules with quiz and assignments. The resources section was of great help. Mentors were always there for help and guidance. if a project is added to this it would be icing on the cake. This platform is just sheer brilliance in the world of education for all ! it was an awesome experience for me. All the best ! ",5
1485,"I would like to thank Sir Andew Ng, the mentor of this class for such a wonderful and motivating course in machine learning. Also i extend my thanks to the support team to provide wonderful support for 24/7. I learnt a lot from this class and hoping to learn more. Hopefully i will somehow use this knowledge to help others and develop better systems for improving life of the neddy ones. Once again i am really very thankful to Standard University and Coursera for providing me such a great platform for improving my skillset.",5
1486,This is great course not only on machine learning but in general. ,5
1487,"While this course was my first with Coursera and with machine learning, I have to say that I enjoyed the format, appreciated the course load, the level of expectations and the review testing material. I do feel that the quizzes and program assignments challenged my understanding and were written to ensured that I took the course seriously and ensured careful attention to the details.  After completing the course, I am happy that I did take it for 'credit' and I hope to use more of the courses here to continue my learning.",5
1488,It's an amazing introductory course to the field of Machine Learning. Prof. Ng simplifies the concepts and explains it very well. The assignments are moderately difficult and depends on how much you grasp and understand the core concepts. Its always better to review the videos/lecture materials and seek clarifications from the discussion forums and keep trying till you find the solution. ,5
1489,"I would definitely recommend this course to those who are starting their journey in ML field. as this course is from Andrew Ng,one of very renowned name in the field of ML, this course can be very well trusted. The teaching is very much intuitive (if you are not advanced maths expert like like, intuition is  very much required to learn concepts. One nice thing abt the course is , it cleared lot of mis-conception of mine around ML and AI and and this course can be treated as a decision tree in terms of ""when to use what"".",5
1490,"Excellent cours pour vraiment aller dans les détails du maching learning. Avec des vidéos pas très longues, des exemples, des quiz et enfin des exercices, le tout bien mené par le prof Andrew NG  sans oublier le forum de discussion où les interventions des deux mentors Neil OSTROVE et Tom MOSHER constituent un encadrement professionnel et des fois même un complément de cours.",5
1491,"This course is a blind 5 star for me, it gave me in-depth knowledge of internals of machine learning and the best online course in my entire professional career.  I highly recommend this course to all information technology professional who are serious to leverage this machine learning to solve complex and unsolvable business problems of the world. My salute to Professor Andrew Ng for his contributions to provide a platform where anyone from any where in the world and from diverse backgrounds can master Machine Learning. ",5
1492,"I highly recommend this course to anyone interested machine learning even with no prior knowledge of the subject (though I did program already, so I can't speak to that). I now feel confident enough to delve into more advanced machine learning algorithms, and know enough already to apply it to my research as a neuroscientist. Andrew Ng is a passionate and relatable professor who presents material in an easily digestible way, and what better person to learn from than one of the world's leading experts in machine learning.",5
1493,"Amazing Course really! I want to thank so much Mr. Andrew Ng for taking his time and effort to give me, personally, and the many others who took this course, a big part of his vast insights into the matter of Machine Learning! It was such a fun taking this class, watching the videos, and working on the practical examples. Now, I feel confident that I could implement much of what I've learned here to my personal projects, and contribute to the advances of learning algorithms in Space Science particularly. Thank you again!",5
1494,"Great course, the teacher did a very good job explaining a very difficult subject to a group of students with signifficantly different backgrounds.",5
1495,I really liked the course. The content and the way it is presented was perfect to keep me motivated and keep on studying even though especially the programming exercises were quite challenging some times.,5
1496,Great course and very easy to follow along with Prof. N.G. The explanations are very simple and precise and gives a gentle introduction to the world of Machine Learning. Algorithms are explained without delving into too much mathematical detail and the programming exercises in the modules help to understand the topics better and implement them in real life. Would have been great if python was chosen as the preferred language but MATLAB/Octave is good for implementation without much syntax. Best place to start off in ML!,5
1497,As a very novice to Machine Learning and Data Science this course has helped me learn a lot about how the algorithms work. Much of the mathematical terms pretty much went way over my head. Still I tried to keep going the course and now when I see some articles and output values from models I do understands them if not with 100% clarity at least with basic understanding. I am very grateful for having this course for free. I might not been able to watch go through the exercises if I had to purchase for viewing the course.,5
1498,"Great course! Probably the best I've ever taken. Everything is well explained and it was wonderful to see
how Andrew predicts the questions which are likely to arise during the
lecture. On the other hand, he knows how to ask right questions to make the
brain work. Programming exercises are engaging and the guidelines are very
thorough. I really loved about
this course is that we studied where and how to apply the algorithms we learned to
real-world problems. In fact, the programming assignments were real-world
examples.",5
1499,"Prof. Andrew Ng has done a great job and put lots of efforts to teach this Introductory course in Machine Learning. It was a great experience to learn from one of the greatest scientist in the field of Machine Learning. This wouldn't have been possible without a wonderful online learning ecosystem created by coursera which provides a great conducive environment for learning. I wish Prof. Andrew Ng. comes up with a more advanced version of this course on the lines of Stanford CS229.  Thank you, Prof Andrew Ng & Coursera. ",5
1500,"The course features exceptional, clear explanations of popular machine learning algorithms as well as their applications and methods for diagnosing and debugging problems. The programming assignments are challenging, but doable and I really felt I learned and retained something after finishing each of them. Overall, the only weakness I can think of is the absence of certain mathematical details like proofs, but that sort of thing is beyond the scope of an introductory online course for the subject, so not a major issue.",5
1501,"Wonderful approach by Andrew Ng on the concepts in Machine Learning. It slowly picks up pace, reaches a crescendo early in the course (In week 5... Man... what an assignment that is)... And a gentle slope about supporting concepts on machine learning later.  Without Tom Mosher's helpful tips, inputs and resources, I could not have finished this course. Interestingly, I got to know more about human learning by going through this course.  Glad that I took this course and got to learn it.. Thank you Andrew NG & Coursera !! ",5
1502,"This course serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning.  I had a full time job for the duration of the time I spent working on this course, and I found I was able to immediately apply the things I learned in this course to my job, sometimes even really surprising and impressing my superiors with the techniques that were covered.  Andrew is an inspiring and effective teacher, and I feel I will retain the knowledge I gained for many years to come.  Suffice it to say my passion for this field has been ignited.",5
1503,Great course!,5
1504,A comprehensive overview of ML and a very useful introduction to Matlab and Octave in particular providing a nice way to refresh/learn some basic linear algebra,5
1505,"Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher and person. We feel that he loves to teach, to share his knowledge to everybody, and so, gives an example. He motivates us to learn, and to use that for helping other people. The course material is very well organized and presented. This is the first Coursera's course that I attended and finished with all its assignments. The platform is complete, perfect, amazing. We stay motivated, and have easy access to all we need to learn and to keep track of the schedule. Thank you all, very much.",5
1506,"It is a great Kickstarter for whoever interested in pursuing machine learning as a career. It deals with the intuitions and basic mathematics involved in Machine learning. Though there are many other courses that can be useful for learners for understanding the basics, those courses go straight into the code and focus only on the application part( Don't get me wrong- this is my perspective). This course is unlike those and gives the learners the right knowledge on algorithms that are now backbones of complex algorithms ",5
1507,"Great foundation course on Machine Learning. Loved the pace, and the theoretical background behind some of the most commonly used supervised and un-supervised learnings, techniques to evaluate and diagnose the algorithms and overview of some practical applications. Andrew Ng was great in explaining some of the complex concepts. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to learn about Machine Learning. Requires 6-8 hrs/week for 2.5 months to complete all the videos and the programming assignments on time.",5
1508,"I had gone through different video lectures before I took this course.After completing this course, I think I can very easily figure out, how the things are actually working behind the scene.Other courses were more focused on teaching programming. But this course was a homogeneous mixture of both pure mathematics as well as programming.The hands on exposure provided by this course has laid a strong foundation for me.",5
1509,"O for awesome. This is probably one of the toughest course I'd in last few years. The course contents are very detailed, gives you deep theoretical insight on machine learning which is equipped with practicals. The practicals (coding) are fantastically arranged. Student doesn't have to worry about secondary things like variable initialisations, loading some data etc. They can focus on core ML part. Coursera has arranged MATLAB licence too (though this is optional. Octave is fantastic). All in all, the course is superb.",5
1510,"Altough I had taken Linear Algebra course long time ago and not knowing the language programming Ocatve, I was able to understand the course and complete the exercises.  I had started before some other classes, but this one was the best structured and delivered. I feel that I can use this knowledge to implement some machine learning  algorithms. However, you must preview long hours to complete the course if you don't have all the required skills.",5
1511,"
I am very grateful for Sir Andrew Ng to take step ahead of traditional school and reaching interested learner all over the world in large. I get the concepts discussed throughout the course very significant to implement machine learning to solve practical problems. Its assignments are quite helpful to trainees to develop practical skills and build their confidence. I also wanna mention that the in course quiz help me keep focused while I attend the lecture. Finally thank you Sir Andrew Ng and I wish you all the best !",5
1512,"I learned a lot of things about working with Data, principles of ML and its algorithms in this course. Also, it clarified beautiful meanings behind ML notion not just introducing some algorithms without lightening their background. I really enjoyed doing its homework, because they were amazing and had useful ideas, which I can use them in practice. I learned about implementing ML algorithms in Matlab and how to improve their performance. I really like this course and hope many other people can also have fun with it :)",5
1513,"Before taking this course, I had already made ML classes in my university, and for me it was very complicated and frustrating to understand the math concepts behind it.",5
1514,The course is well designed for a person who has just started in the ML field. Every concept and algorithm is explained while running through examples. The course covers almost every aspect of machine learning. It helped me a lot in developing understanding of the machine learning systems and algorithms. I would like to thank Andrew for designing this course and making those most complicated things much easier to understand. I highly recommend this course for everybody who wants to start a career in Machine Learning.,5
1515,"This course is very in-depth relative to other courses on Coursera. Professor Ng is very knowledgeable and does a really good job explaining such a difficult concept with zero prior experience. If you are coming into this course with no prior knowledge, you will have to use the discussion forums to do the assignments. Even if you do not know how to do the assignments, you will understand the theory behind the concepts regardless.",5
1516,"During 2 months, all the mathematics and algorithms of Supervised learning (Linear Regression, Logistics Regression, Neural Network, SVM), Unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA, Anomaly detection), Recomender Systerm, Large scale machine learning,.. was mostly explained thoroughly in an easy way by Andrew for learners to understand.
",5
1517,"Professor Ng is one of the best teachers I have had the privilege of learning from. His fundamental understanding of both the beautiful mathematical structure behind machine learning algorithms, and practical, real-world solutions to analyze, improve, and prioritize effort on developing these algorithms, is truly inspirational. His clear articulation of this understanding made this course a joy to be in. The programming assignments and review questions strongly reinforced my learning from the lectures. Great course.",5
1518,Awsome!!!,5
1519,"Very interesting course, Andrew Ng has a great ability to make understand the concepts related to Machine Learning. The lectures' material is very clear. The programming assignments are well done: the main scripts are already written and only the functions related to the topic of the week need to be implemented. The student can then focus on consolidating what has been learned during the week instead of debugging unrelated issues.",5
1520,"It has been exceptional course by Professor Andrew NG, it has provided me an wholesome introduction in world of Machine learning about which I didn't had any clue just few months back. Now, I can aspire of having a career in this field currently being computer science undergraduate. Sir your teaching and specially advice for machine learning is phenomenal and unparalleled with ANY OTHER EDUCATION available offline or online to students like us in India .Great Respect for you sir I owe my future career in ML to you. ",5
1521,"Andrew Ng's Machine Learning 12-week course is a good rigorous one that covers the broad range of tools.  He teaches in an easy to understand, respectful, encouraging, yet deeply foundational.  The course is well made, quizzes make you study and take notes while listening to the videos, the programming exercises help illustrate in ""hands-on"" terms without paralyzing you with frustration.   It is a good foundation for the Deep Learning Specialization also from deeplearning.ai; also well made, taught in the same way.",5
1522,Andrew is an exceptional teacher and this course is really well done with great care and keeping variety of students in mind. His patience  to go over the course in greater details while maintaining a comfortable pace is remarkable. I really enjoyed learning though this course and would highly recommend to anyone wanted to learn machine learning. Andrew also has a unique ability to turn a complex and difficult concept and make it sound like relatively normal difficult level and thus keeping his students encouraged. ,5
1523,"Very Good course. A must for everyone who wants to get their basics in ML. Andrew NG makes it very helpful for average students like me to understand the concept very well. Adequate support is available through resources, forums , tutorials and testcases. I would recommend this course highly. ",5
1524,,5
1525,"Excellent class, in terms of specific content and didactical approach. ",5
1526,"I was amazed to find out
that this course has proven to be a lot more rewarding than I imagined it to
be. All the material was carefully selected and intuitively
explained. Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers that I’ve ever had
the pleasure to learn from. His way of explaining difficult and complex
concepts so easily and intuitively is extraordinary. A lot of topics, that were
quite difficult to comprehend before, seemed so easy to understand after
Andrew’s explanation that I wondered why I didn’t get it before.  ",5
1527,"What a formidable journey ! Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers I ever had and one of the few who have the art of explaining complex things easily. I now have a better vision of creating a machine learning system (I had a prior experience) and a strong theroy of mathematics behind the algorithms. I think that this course is a must-have for every person aiming to become a machine learning enginneer. Finally, I want to thank coursera for giving the opportunity to get this course through their financial aid system.",5
1528,"The course has an interesting syllabus and covers the main introductory topics about machine learning. Although I am graduated in statistics, the approach used in ML is pretty different than pure statistics and, I would even  say, a more effective and practical one in certain contexts. Defenitely a great course and I thanks Professor Andrew Ng for the high level he has kept all over the lectures. I lastly recommed him to improve the chapter about SVM, which in my opinion is the only topic I found to be less clear.",5
1529,Learnt lot of basics from the course instructor Andrew Ng sir. They become much clear by solving the programming assignments. The assignments are designed in such a way that even a slow learning student can catch up to speed by following all the instructions given in the assignments. The main reason that I didn't leave the course in between is because of the interest and satisfaction that I used to get while solving the programming assignments. Thanks to the professor and his staff for a great learning experience.,5
1530,"first of all, thanks Andrew's fantastic machine learning class, it's proud to be his student, through the class, I learned a lot, linear regression, LR, SVM, clustering, and so on, many alogrithms and some system thinking, which would be useful in the future. sum it up, it's a great class, and suit for the entry level people who want to build career in AI, hope everybody could take that class and apply the machine learning technology to the real world, that's would be awesome. thanks again for Andrew and Coursera.",5
1531,"This truly is a great course to get a good understanding of what machine learning is and how to apply the concepts int he real world. It also gives a great chance to learn to program in Octave or MathLab. If you want to learn machine learning and you don't have any experience in it, then this is the course for you! You will be able to apply the concepts at the end, but like every discipline, you must do it and continue on your own to force it to sink in.",5
1532,"I just finished this course and, although this was the first course I've taken on coursera, I know that not all courses will be like this one. I can tell that tons of work was put into developing this class (thank you), because all of the material was incredibly useful, presented with perfection and very easily digestible. My original intent was to not pay for the certificate, but very quickly I felt that any prospective employer should know that I have knowledge of the powerful tools I've learned from this class.",5
1533,A great review.  Andrew gives very clear yet detailed analysis about how to think about machine learning problems.  The details and fundamentals of the most popular learning algorithms are taught; however I think the most valuable pieces of information are shown when Andrew teaches how to evaluate and fix learning algorithms that aren't behaving as expected.  A great introduction to machine learning; the course also teaches the necessary linear algebra and matlab/octave skills needed to implement these algorithms.,5
1534,Awesome/Excellent/Outstanding !!!  This course was my first step in Machine Learning en route to data science. The videos explain difficult concepts in easy to understand words with examples. The assignments will make you think real hard and they do a great job to ensure that you get basics down and give you wings to implement an algorithm to a real world data set. The discussion/forum/wiki_page is very helpful and thanks to the Mentors for immediate help with questions on the forums.,5
1535,"Great Course, Simplified way of understanding the topic, although i was expecting machine learning to be much harder than that,, the teacher could convince me that it's not that hard and that i really do it and pass,, it was fun taking this course, i was really enjoying it, thanks to the great motivator Professor Andrew, thank you very much for your efforts. i know now i'm ready to work on much harder machine learning application and much more sophisticated ones, 100% satisfied  :))",5
1536,"This course was fantastic! Andrew is a great lecturer and I never felt like the things he was saying were superfluous or unnecessary. The topics in the class were also a good compromise between a wide spread and an in depth view of the topics in ML. If there were anything I wish were in the class, was maybe more mathematical justification behind some derivations, but ultimately I could find them myself so maybe the course is perfect in that it gives you just enough to explore for yourself. Overall, great course!!",5
1537,"One of the best Machine Learning introductory courses available which will give you the necessary foundation to start your first projects. The classes are very well designed and the progression through the concepts and techniques feels natural. Andrew Ng explains difficult topics in such a understanble way that you will hardly feel lost throughout this course, he is a great teacher. Overall this course helped me to kickstart career into ML and I strongly recommend it for aspiring data scientists and ML engineers.",5
1538,"Lectures were clear and helpful, and I now feel I have at least a basic grasp on the fundamentals of machine learning.  For me the programming assignments were quite easy once I got comfortable with Matlab.  You do learn how to vectorize your code, which is I think one of the most useful things I took away from this course.  I kind of wish the exercise instructions didn't give away most of the details of the problems--for many of them you can just copy the equations given in the instructions without much thought.",5
1539,"Andrew Nj has a great experience about practicing ML. He gave us in this course, a very large idea of  algorithms used in different problems. In addition, which I really appreciated, he teaches us how to set up a real implementation strategy for a solution based on machine learning. The programming exercises were very useful to understand which way we can treat a real problem.  In conclusion, I'm very proud to succeed this program, and confident about how I will go on with real applications. Thank's a lot Andrew.",5
1540,"When I was studiing the course, almost no one of the topics seemed too hard to understand (except of the backpropagation alghorythm, for which I had to found additional resourses, and may be few other topics) . But know, looking back to the course, I understand, there were a lot of quite complicated things. This fact says a lot about tutitor's talent (to make hard and complicated things not so hard to understand is a rare skill even for University professors). So, thank you, Mr. Ng for making a brilliant course.",5
1541,"The Course was very interesting and intriguing. Each video offered an important insight into some important aspect. The programming exercises were enjoyable but difficult, and they helped me learn how to implement my algorithm. The only issue I have is that some of the videos are very long and difficult to watch. I often watched at 1.5X speed, which I would recommend if you can still pay attention. Even with this problem, the course was still amazing and enjoyable. I learned all the math I needed along the way.",5
1542,"Excellent Course, one of the best I have ever attended!! Superior knowledge and presentation of material, I wish I could meet professor Andrew some time in-person, I have become a fan, sir!! It has been an honor to have had an opportunity to attend this class.. and I wish I could attend more of your sessions!! This course was offered for no cost, and I am so thankful! I will make sure I take the certificate, and gain the pride of knowing where I got it from!! Thanks so much, Professor Andrew! You are the best!!",5
1543,"Now I can understand the main concepts of machine learning. I think I acquired a wide and acceptably solid base on which to grow in knowledge.  I can identify the different types of problems faced by machine learning, and what kind of solutions or algorithms would be applicable. I knew and approached the Octave programming language. I intend to bring this new range of knowledge into stock trading, and I believe that over time I will achieve better results in that area, or a better understanding of the business.",5
1544,This is a very good course. It provides a good basic understanding of the subject. Professor Ng is a great teacher who conveys his enthusiasm in the topic. Having experience with Matlab and Linear Algebra does make this course a lot easier. Much props for those who finish this course without having prior knowledge about these or similar subjects. I would maybe first advice to take a basic Matlab course before starting this one. Having to master Matlab while delving into Machine Learning might be a bit too much.,5
1545,"It is an excellent course, I will recommend it to anyone who wish to start a career in AI. There is no other online course on Machine Learning that even comes near it in terms of quality of content and delivery method You will learn a lot  of topics in this course but I think most important topics are advice on using ML  and debugging ML systems (Week 6,7,8,10,11). If you are taking this course to start a career in AI do full assignments, they are really easy to complete and yet to so fun to learn the concepts. ",5
1546,"I learned a lot from this course. Professor Ng is such a great teacher that not only did he made abstract concepts easily understandable by using examples and illustrations, but he also re-ignite the interest in your hearts to make you fall in love with the subject. I cant remember when was the last time I voluntarily keep staying up to revisit the concepts covered in the course just to make sure I have full understanding in them. I am so motivated and now I am ready for the next course. Thank you Professor Ng.",5
1547,"Perfect courses! By this course, I have learnt many things about Machine Learning. True, it is so wonderful that Andrew Ng could take many abstract concepts into  some straightforward things, thanks a lots! I can guarantee that if you could insist on completing this course totally, you would find you've mastered many useful knowledge. Of course, knowledge is endless, if you're really interested in this field, then go for it by as many methods as possible you can find, and don't restrict yourself to this course.",5
1548,"Very good introduction to machine learning course! No prior background in statistics or linear algebra is needed as everything is self-contained. Familiarity is always helpful but generous help can always be found in the discussion forms. The lectures are short and to the point as they survey a wide background of standard machine learning techniques. The assignments also don't take too much time given some programming background. Overall, great course and would highly recommend to anyone considering taking it! ",5
1549,Great course to learn the basics of machine learning. The selection of the topics makes it a great course to understand the overall picture of the field. Andrew Ng is also a very good teacher and it is easy to enjoy the lectures. The programming exercises are basic but are designed in a way that while doing them you will understand all the components that have to come into place to implement a machine learning algorithm. People with little programming experience will appreciate this. Thank you for this course.,5
1550,"Class design is great! I appreciate Andrews special ability to explain complicated issue in simply way!  The programming assignments are fun, all the surrounding supporting routines are given, so that I can focus on the  key concept of exercises.  Also, I learn quit some by reading those supporting routines that put everything together.  I found myself miss the programming assignment in last two weeks' lecture.  Excellent class, I would recommend to anyone who are interested and new in machine learning topics. ",5
1551,"I had applied for this course and also started learning new things since i am also working with huge data ,by applying this algorithm I can able to solve real world problems .It made me to distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning (clusetering). The faculty has just provided the simple -simple examples which can help anyone to learn easily .It enhanced my skill set also.It was worth watching.Now I want to explore some more courses from COURSERA.This course helped me to improve my employability .",5
1552,"ML with Andrew Ng is a great course with challenges for beginners, intermediates, and advanced engineers. Learn approaches to regression, algorithms, neural networks, classifiers, numerical analysis, and many methods for problem solving. There is more than 20 hours of programming (a great intro to linear algebra and Matlab), and some challenging quizzes, but the lecture and review makes it easy to brush up. Would recommend to anyone interested in computer science, data engineering, and artificial intelligence.",5
1553,"This course is very good!! Recommended for those of you who wants to learn about ML even from zero! Only required small knowledge of maths (differential, linear algebra, statistics) or programming. These are some of the reasons:",5
1554,"This was a truly amazing course. Not only Prof. Ng teaches the theory behing machine learning, but also he shares his significant wisdom and experience on how to apply the algorithms, what to do, and most importantly what not to do, and how to spend your time, how to make error and ceiling analyses etc... The pedagogy of the course is amazing; even if the theory sometimes is not clear, it becomes very clear after completing the exercises. Thank you very much Prof. Ng and all TAs for helping me improve myself! ",5
1555,Excellent course to dive into the world of machine learning. Professor Andrew Ng. is an excellent teacher. Besides Machine Learning concepts I have learnt a good deal of math mainly linear algebra in this course. The choice of Octave language made me personally feel it better to understand the linear algebra implementation in programming easier and it will help me to easily implement those using the libraries of other programming languages. A must take course for anyone who wants to get into Machine Learning.,5
1556,"I never imagined I would be completing this on time. I should say I was fortunate to end up here and complete it successfully. Thank you, Andrew, for this wonderful course. For me, it's been a black box, after this completing the class gave all the insights of every machine learning concepts and the assignments were top-notch with all the instruction pre-written scripts. Good knowledge runs for me these past 11 weeks. Thank you all the mentors and fellow students for the timely response to my naive questions.",5
1557,"This was an excellent course. Not only did it introduce Machine Learning in a simple, easy to understand manner, but also provided practical examples and challenging review and quiz questions that really re-enforced the material. I am grateful for Andrew Ng's dedication to this work and feel that based solely on this single course, I can apply the lessons learned directly to my work.",5
1558,"It feels great to learn from the best!!! Thank you, Coursera for this great opportunity. I thoroughly enjoyed this learning experience. For the beginners, when I started machine learning 2 years back (around 2016) on youtube platform from stanford classes, I could not able to understand a single concept, now I completed the course and I am confident enough to implement ML on my applications. I surely recommend this course to anybody interested in ML. Once again, thank you, Andrew Ng for sharing the knowledge.",5
1559,"I liked it very much. Prof. Ng takes care to explain even things that might appear ""trivial"" to some, but this is a plus because it is inclusive of people with all walks of life (and for everyone else there's Coursera's acceleration of videos at 1.25 or 1.5). The breadth of the material seems fair, even though some technologies are not touched at all, but for a starting course it's perfect because it sets the stage to provide at least the higher level taxonomy of problems and introduced the right terminology.",5
1560,"This is a very good course overall. Machine learning was not totally new to me but I still learned a lot from this course. Coding in Octave is actually not as boring as I expected. It's very hard to find other courses that better explain the details of how to implement machine learning algorithms. It is nice to have a summarized lecture notes in pdf before each quiz and assignment. Only 1 suggestion is there is some minor error or typo in lectures that can be corrected, and the submit script needs be patched.",5
1561,"I am a big advocate of MOOCs  as it definitely democratize education.  Only challenge with MOOCs is that over time they become too monotonous and one looses out the interest. I've tried to take up few machine learning courses over past few years, but never got past first few steps. I am still in the going through the course, but so far it has been an outstanding experience. Not only the content is engaging, it has been really simplified. If you're new to Machine learning, I can't recommend this highly enough.",5
1562,"This course is well structured, starting from the more basic concepts and building on those as it goes. The practical advice is also a breath of fresh air compared to most other courses which just give you theory and leave you hung out to dry when it comes to application of what you have learned, and how to figure out where you might have gone wrong. Andrew Ng is great at explaining things, and doesn't make you fuss around with things you don't really need to know to be a useful machine learning practitioner. ",5
1563,I am a chemist/biologist without any formal computational training or strong background in mathematics. This course has helped me grasp concepts around machine learning which I feel are increasingly important in the field of computational biology and given me the confidence to pursue projects in machine learning. I believe this will be an important skill for my ongoing career and am very thankful for the material and the opportunity to grow outside of my career. ,5
1564,If you want to start with Machine Learning this course is for you.,5
1565,"Best course I have ever enrolled in. Great theoretical outlook and machine learning, going through the most important issues that one might encounter when starting to solve real world problems.",5
1566,It is really very intense course. It took me a long while to complete it but the time and efforts put together is worth it. Now I am confident about the larger proportion of what I know about machine learning. I would like extend my gratitude to Andrew Ng sir and the whole team who made such a wonderful course. It is really helping many beginners as well as professionals in the field. Thank you so much for providing me the financial aid. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to the course in any way.,5
1567,"Fabulous course! Andrew clearly has both a strong academic, and practical understanding of Machine Learning. You will leave this course seeing all kinds of places you can apply machine learning, both professionally and personally. And, you will feel confident that you have a solid grounding to approach whatever domain you intend to tackle. I cannot say enough good things about this course. Worth every minute, and I will likely re-watch videos and read course materials as reference material for years to come.",5
1568,"This course is extremely well explained, and help is bountifully provided when needed in the tutorials, videos, and forums. I learned many new things in every video and I was tested on this newfound knowledge in every quiz and was especially put to the test in the programming assignments. At the same time, this course is so useful because it can be applied to so many things in life. This course is thorough and is excellent for beginners who are interested in learning about machine learning. ITS ALSO FREE!!!!",5
1569,"Sometimes it is difficult to determine where to spend your time learning new skills, techniques and increasing your knowledge base. This course is exceptional and definitely well worth your time and money. Using Octave (and trusting Dr. Ng) was the best way to learn the machine learning concepts to which I can now apply using other programming languages.",5
1570,"This is the first Coursera class I have taken.  I was struck by the breath of the content, the utility of how to apply it, and the approach by Professor Ng in explaining sometimes complex subject matter.",5
1571,"The course helped brush up on my math. Also, I learned a lot of useful machine learning algorithms that I will definitely use in the feature. What I would have liked more is that the professor could have went more deep into the math. For example, for Support Vector Machines and backpropagation for neural networks. But, I understand that he wanted to make it more accessible for many people.",5
1572,"I strongly recommend this class. The course is well organized; for each topic, Andrew Ng starts with a simple and intuitively-understandable example and then moves on to more advanced or complicated  examples. His explanation is very straightforward and kind; when necessary, he explain things from various aspects, which allow students to have a deep understanding of the topic. He not only provides machine learning skills, but also mention some basic strategies to improve the code or productivity of the team.",5
1573,"Very focused approach. I am grateful to Andrew Ng for taking the timeout to create this course. According to his statement at Lex Friedman Podcast he worked on these lectures at night after work. Similar to a lot of people who would like this course to be the first step in their machine learning journey. He is indeed very humble despite of his tall achievements and you can sense it in the way he teaches the concepts slowly and with illustrated examples. Highly recommended for anyone , not just the beginner.",5
1574,"This course is an best  introduction to machine learning I have learned, although which is pretty easier than CS229 in Stanford. So, next, I would learn CS229 in opening course online, but it's pretty that accessible online videos abut CS229 haven't update for many years  and finally to study the opening courses on the deeplearning.ai. Thanks  AP Andrew NG for providing so amazing courses  free and it's a good chance to enjoy carefully designed courses particularly for students from not-developed countries.",5
1575,"This course is a great introduction to machine learning. Although I would have preferred to use python for the programming exercises, using Matlab (Octave) was not too bad and it helped me learn the actual math behind some of the libraries in other languages. It is important to note that it is an introductory course and some advanced topics (such as deep learning) are not covered, so people with a basic knowledge of machine learning might benefit from a more specialized course. In general, I liked it a lot. ",5
1576,"A very interesting and challenging class. Very well taught at a good pace and with plenty of support materials to help get through programming assignments and quizzes.  The programming assignments though tricky in parts thankfully focused on only adding the critical elements so did not require writing a large volume of code.  Although coding those critical elements involved using new parts of my brain.  All in all, thank you Andrew Ng for a good class.  Also thanks to the supportive and responsive ""tutors."" ",5
1577,"Excellent course - simple, direct, and hands on but at the same time comprehensive and deep enough so that students of all levels can follow along and learn!",5
1578,"Really really great course. Went to machine learning meetup where this course was constantly mentioned, so I decided to do it. Very happy I did. As a senior developer, I can now have a conversation with the data guys, and can even bring some ideas to the table. ",5
1579,"I took this course during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I was busy with my own research and study, but it was like being in a warm home for me to open this course, listen to Professor Ng's qualified, well-thought, and sincere lecturing, and working on a amazing subject here. So it wasn't just that I took a course on Coursera, but also that I was with a very good and motivational teacher in my home. I'm looking forward to use what I learn in my future physics research. Thanks to all who contributed to this course. ",5
1580,"Fantastic course. You get a lot of knowledge and advice. Even if you don-t have all the knowledge in math, stats, You still get to understand what skills you are missing or you would need to get a deeper understanding.",5
1581,"Andrew is a really good instructor and has rich experience in ml. He can explain things in a very simple and intuitive way. I heard of many concept in ml before but in his class, his explanation is always the simplest and easy to understand. Very few math knowledge is needed for this class, I will say even a high school level math knowledge can handle the math problems in this class. Thank you Andrew and I will keep working on learning more advanced knowledge by myself and thanks for motivate us this much. ",5
1582,"This course should be the 101 course for any Machine Learning beginner. Instructor was awesome in explaining the theoretical aspects of ML. The only drawback (in my opinion) was that the assignment were to be done on Octave. Besides, I am now confident that I am aware about the alphabets of Machine Learning. I totally recommend this course for people who're thinking of getting their hands on Machine Learning. Now, I am not being able to stop myself from enrolling into ""Deep Learning Specialization"" course.",5
1583,,5
1584,"The lectures are great, and they are reinforced with the quizzes and programming exercises. The quizzes need critical thinking to get all of them correctly. The programming assignments are there to cover the basic concepts.",5
1585,"I surely can approve, that this is one of the best class devoted for machine learning. Although programming exercises does not cover popular Python/R languages for ML, It gives you a basics of ML that will guide you to which fields of ML you have to go next, which algorithms to look at your particular language independently whether it Python, Java, etc. Very convenient and fully-detailed programming exercises. A big thank for prof. Ng and to all other mentors who participated in developing of this course.",5
1586,Fantastic experience and a lot of fun.,5
1587,"Big THANK YOU to Andrew Ng for this amazing course. When a professor succeeds in making students passionate about the topic, that menas the course is a success. I feel honored to have had the opportunity to follow one of your courses because really you are an amazing professor. I've been following many engineering university courses in my life, and this is definitely one -if not the- best course I've ever had.",5
1588,"Best course I ever enrolled in. The first few days were a bit challenging, but Andrew is an outstanding professor and has a magical way of deconstructing complex topics into understandable little pieces. It's safe to say that by the time I finished I was excited about the accomplishments, but at the same time, I felt a little pain because I had to say goodbye.",5
1589,A fantastic course by a legend in machine learning. Just the right amount of math combined with very many practical and real examples. Difficulty wise very manageable if you're proficient in an imperative language and have a good basic understanding of linear algebra. I especially liked that Andrew focused a lot on analyzing and debugging the performance and behavior of your application with very good advice on how to address and issues rather than blindly throw everything into a NN and hope for the best.,5
1590,I am 3rd year undergrad student of electrical engineering. I found this course extremely useful and it felt like this course was specifically designed for me as I had no knowledge of machine learning before. I was just familiar with matlab environment and linear algebra. Overall this was an amazing experience learning from Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera platform. I am thankful to all of people who contributed in development of this course especially Tom Mosher (Moderator) whose answers were very much useful.,5
1591,"Great class. The PCA section avoids the SVD and uses non-standard notation for the projection. The columns of V form a basis for the row-space of the design matrix X=USV^T, but the professor uses U instead, typically reserved for the basis of the column space. It is very confusing as a result and won't port over to almost any other book I've seen. Another minor quip is that the videos pause and ask you a question sometimes before they even discuss the topic. All in all I am very thankful I took the class.",5
1592,"Great course! I started with 1/5 knowledge of both analytics and coding, and I was able to get through this course with some serious effort. My biggest hurdles were the 3-hour programming assignments, primarily due to limited professional experience coding. But the tutorials, and forums are really helpful. I realize after completing the course that the retention of concepts, and practical examples has been surprisingly high. I feel like I have really learnt something and will be looking to build on this. ",5
1593,"It has been amazing to be a part of this machine learning course! Professor Ng managed to explain the material enormously well and transferred the intuition about various algorithms or practical situations so easily and naturally. The review quiz questions certainly were very useful to check the understanding of the lecture material and the exercises have been very well-guided, well-documented and provided interesting ways how these algorithms can be applied. Thank you very much for this excellent cours!

",5
1594,"Prof. Andrew Ng is one the best professors for Machine Learning. He is outstanding in explaining complex mathematical concepts in simple language. I have extremly enjoyed the course and I feel so motivated to continue learning ML. Now that I read about ML from other books or talk with ML experts, I realize how much I have learned from Prof. Ng. I wish I had taken this course early when it was posted. If you have interest in ML, start learning from this course now. It's never too late! Thank you Prof. Ng!",5
1595,"*It turns out* that this is a wonderful course for anyone who wants to know more about machine learning. *Concretely*, it covers not just an introduction of machine learning but also the technical aspect of how it's being enabled in various scenarios. *The intuition* of it is the walking through of algorithms and practical exercise to gain a much deeper understanding of the topics itself.  :)",5
1596,"Simply excellent. I was a complete novice to machine learning before starting this course; I feel now that I have a very solid basis indeed, with many (advanced, even) topics being covered. This course is of a somewhat advanced level, knowing linear algebra certainly helps. The instructor is clearly very knowledgeable and finds fun in teaching. Programming assignments are illustrative, diverse, well-designed and of a good difficulty and didactic value. Perfect 10/10 score from me. Thank you professor Ng!",5
1597,Anyone could simply search and find the algorithms at the heart of machine learning. The real value of this course is being able to implement those algorithms without worrying about the details. Professor Ng provides great detail and intuition into some of the most powerful statistical tools used in machine learning and how to use them efficiently. I found it very helpful to learn from someone with so much experience who provided much needed advice on how to get the most out of a machine learning system.,5
1598,"If all of my University courses were like this course, I would have better enjoyed my engineering program. Having the course notes, the videos, and even the mid-video quizzes really helped the concepts sink in. Kudos on the question design as these really test for solid understanding of the concepts. Although, the wording of the questions can sometimes be confusing. Overall, Professor Andrew Ng is a phenomenal instructor! It was a pleasure watching all of the videos, and the apps (web, iOS) are all great",5
1599,"Machine Learning with Andrew Ng is a fantastic course for those with a programming and math background.  By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of many Machine Learning concepts and how Machine Learning is used to solve many real-world challenges.  You will also be able to confidently apply the skills and methods learned to your own business problems.  I thoroughly enjoyed this course and highly recommend it as a point of entry into the fun and interesting world of Machine Learning",5
1600,"I see that there are a lot of situations(in your offices, work place, projects, etc.) where not enough people there and seriously in need of more helping hands. I myself am working in the company like that. I strongly feel that computers and AI can help solving the problem. By taking this course, I could be more confident about that and felt happy about becoming more specialized in machine learning. I really want to say thank you to Mr.Andrew Ng for providing all these awesome and sophisticated lectures.",5
1601,"This course covers a wide variety topics in Machine Learning, from simple linear regression, logistic regression to neural network and support vector machine. It also covers basic unsupervised learning topics  in clustering and dimensional reduction. This course also provides some guidances on practical machine learning such as parameters tuning , determinization of data overfitting/underfitting, basic large scale training and speed up issues, and provides some practical applications in machine learning. ",5
1602,"I'd like to express my much gratitude for Dr. Wu for his many efforts of teaching this course. This course provided me a basic understanding of the machine learning algorithms, which I once felt quite involved and difficult to learn. Dr. Wu used many examples to provide intuition behind the theories, which helped me a lot. I believe that AI is shaping our future and I'm now studying hard to get prepared. After gaining more confidence through learning this course, I'll further my education in this field.",5
1603,"This was my first course in Machine Learning. I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng. for giving dedication and spending time making such a great course. All the concepts were explained very well. The review questions were tricky and conceptual, with great programming exercises. Another thing that I found great is the industry reference made, and that the same technology is being used in the Silicon Valley. He also motivates to build great and cool products. Thank you Coursera. Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng.",5
1604,Excellent introduction to Machine Learning.  Professor Ng does an excellent job of presenting a wide range of ML topics in some depth and colors his explanations with what he has seen in practice.  It would be easy to trip into a theoretical rabbit hole but Professor Ng effectively keeps the focus on employing the concepts to develop algorithms and practical methods to apply ML.,5
1605,"Extremely useful for the understanding on how to make an algorithm perform properly. I already had a background in machine learning (essentially the maths of machine learning), but what I learned re: regularisation, learning curves, measuring the performance of a machine learning system was definitely worth the time. I brought significant improvements to the algorithms I work on in my company thanks to this course. Many thanks for providing such knowledge to the public, in particular with such pedagogy.",5
1606,"This is an excellent course for the beginners in Machine Learning. Octave is a very good tool, but my suggestions would be to include Python and R alongside as an option for the learners so that they get the hands-on on them as well to directly benefit their work projects. I enjoyed learning all of the algorithms taught in the course and what is also very effective about this course is how to use vectors/matrices as opposed to for loops. I am thankful to Prof. Andrew for a wonderful learning experience. ",5
1607,"I feel like I really learned a lot about
machine learning in a very efficient way. Andrew Ng is very pedagogical,
and explains the concepts in a compelling way with much focus on developing your
intuition. ",5
1608,"Probably the best online course I've done. Andrew NG of course knows the topic in and out, what floored me was the level of technical detail and preparation and responsiveness that the course managed to achieve. The exercises' level was challenging but not impossible, good guidance and tips were provided, and the neat way of judging the submissions at each stage really helped and motivated me to keep at it till  I got it right. Thank you Andrew, and I look forward to more courses from you in the future!",5
1609,This is an outstanding course to learn the basic mathematics behind machine learning algorithms. Other courses on Machine Learning just tell you how to use direct library functions to apply Machine Learning algorithm but Andrew Sir has clearly told how an algorithm actually works. The assignments given at the end of week are also very helpful to apply the concepts learnt in the course. These qualities makes this course stand out from all other online courses. I'm so glad to have came across this course.,5
1610,"After a very intense study in one month, it really broaden my horizon of how to fit datasets in various model and better understand them in all directions. As an experimental Ph. D student, I want to thank  the professor for such nice lectures and organized format of every materials since all the algorithms and mathematical bases inspire me and let me regain power to grab the math and coding learned as undergraduate. I would like to recommend this course to everyone with basic linear algebra background.  ",5
1611,"This course in machine learning is one of the best online courses available in the internet. It gives a grand picture about how ML works , when to use a specific algorithm and practical advices with enough details. Even if someone who has some gaps in the mathematics can also understand these algorithms ( This course will also give you  basics of matrix operations and how to use them in Octave/MATLAB  . I'm really grateful to Andrew Ng, Coursera and Stanford University for such a great course.",5
1612,I can strongly say this course was a huge improvement for me.,5
1613,"Andrew Ng explains the information in a very clear manner. The course is nicely structured, contains many informative examples and graphics. Programming tasks for Octave are prepared, data gets loaded automatically. Students are focused on the actual algorithm implementation tasks rather then on the boilerplate code. Also I found task submission feature very useful because it provides a convenient approach to get task uploaded and assessed almost instantly.",5
1614,Its an excellent course for budding as well as experienced Data scientists. It covers a lot of important topics well enough to understand and start implementing on real world problems. The most interesting aspect of this course is that Prof. has explained very tough topics in a very simple manner which is very easy to understand. Thanks a lot to Prof. Andrew Ng. and all the mentors and associates who made this online learning a happy journey for us. Thanks a lot to coursera to make it available online.,5
1615,"It was a great course, the videos are good Andrew NG was great i had a lot of fun.",5
1616,,5
1617,Prof. Ng is very knowledgeable and explains each topic concisely and informatively.,5
1618,"Can't thank enough for offering through this course ! The pace of lessons, insights, brevity of course material and very valuable assignments are right mix for anyone wishing to learn this subject, which one finds often hard  to grasp and apply while learning directly from books, even with technical background. This course is an example of how access top quality learning can be democratized and be brought within reach of so many who wish to learn it. Thank again Prof. Ng and team for this enlightenment ",5
1619,"Amazing course, with a fantastic instructor. Covers everything you need to know and more. This really is a fascinating subject, and the course makes it all easy (or easier) to understand and grounds it on math and objective things, not some black box you don't really understand. A bonus is that it gives a wide variety of techniques to use the machine learning algorithms in real life and actually make them work. Definitely, 100% would recommend. It was one of the best decisions of how to spend my time.",5
1620,"Very good introductory course to machine learning; goes into enough math details with real interesting examples; quizzes and assignments are aligned with the material. Everything sticks to your mind after completion of the course because you see the material a few times (videos, lecture notes, review quizzes and assignments)! It covers supervised linear and logistic regression algorithms as well as unsupervised classification algorithm; combining math with tangible examples; making learning super fun!",5
1621,"The way professor Andrew teaches is Amazing. This ML maybe through Octave but the way Professor Andrew teaches, You can simply implement ML in any language considering you know syntax which is quite easy to find and study. I just loved each and every aspects of this course. Well paced lectures and fairly difficult assignment with lot of help in discussion forum for almost any error you encounter and so finally I want to thank Professor Andrew and All Mentor for making this learning experience awesome.",5
1622,This is one of the best online course I have ever did. Professor Andrew Ng is probably the best instructor in Coursera or any other MOOC platform. The course design is good. The assignments are interesting. I think after finishing this course I am standing in a solid foundation to pursue further self-study in the field of Machine Learning. ,5
1623,"  Very helpful. Fundamental get cleared easily with world class pundit Andrew and a guide like Tom Mosher  . There are reason why this course is highly sought. A small problem I face is that R programming is used industry wide. prefer more than Octave. Hence finding it difficult to participate in any race. Nevertheless with fundamentals from this course, R is just another language. Moreover there are pre-built packages and platform for machine available in the net. What one needs is strong fundamentals.",5
1624,One of the excellent class i have ever taken. This course covers very wide topic in the machine learning subject. When i have enrolled for this course i haven't any idea about this subject. Now i have understood the concepts behind the machine learning and i am confident that i can build upon. Thanks to Prof.Ng for his excellent presentation avoiding complicated mathematical backgrounds to make the subject exciting. Thanks to coursera team members to include a course like this. Overall i have enjoyed.,5
1625,"This is an excellent course, thank you Andrew and team! I have religiously sat through all the videos and thoroughly enjoyed them and have learnt a lot as a result.",5
1626,"Really complete and content rich course, which gets fairly deep into the subject, without ever turning daunting. Everything is properly explained, in a fool-proof manner, yet thoroughly, without ever sacrificing the richness of the contents delivered. The assingments tasks are really well thought of and laid out, and pose an actual challenge, which actually is a great thing.",5
1627,"The course has is dealt with optimal complexity so that overall it reaches out to a large audience. Concepts and rationale behind an algo, important application and caveats, as well as Prof Ng's experience is very well articulated and reflects in the lectures. The mathematical treatment is somewhat limited, but this course is for the application side rather than research. Hence, it justifies the decree to keep mathematics limited. I would recommend it to anyone, who wants to explore machine learning.",5
1628,"It was by far the most demanding and the most fun class ever taken. It reminded me the most challenging times I faced at University, and receiving from Andrew NG at the end of the last video: ""...if you worked all the way through this course you should now consider yourself an expert in machine learning..."" is grateful enough, as a couple of months ago I had just a basic understanding of ML applications, now I have the full set of tools and really understand now the ""magic"" behind it. Thank you back.",5
1629,"For someone who wants to learn Machine Learning as a new skill to apply to a job or just for curiosity, this is the best place to start. I have already recommended this course to a friend of mine. I would recommend it to other persons for sure. It is great, and the bottom-up approach of teaching really helps better understanding Machine Learning algorithms and concepts. ",5
1630,This is an exceptional course from that I have taken in my life.Working on test examples was a great challenge for me because I had to learn not only the principles of Machine Learning but also how to program in Octave and be sure to finish all the tests before the deadline. Without forum section and the help of supervisors it would be impossible for me to finish the course.Thanks to all who helped with advises!!! Especially Tom Mosher!And Big-Big thanks and respect to Andrew Ng (for everything) ! :),5
1631,"Really good basis for learning machine learning with good videos & materials and really well prepared programming exercises in Octave. I learnt a lot and feel that I can now start to develop my own machine learning applications. The class requires very strong mental focus as it is easy to get lost in the many matrices, vectors and indices but this strong focus pays off big time when you see how vectorization improves the speed of these algorithms. Fascinating to see such a payback from pure thinking.",5
1632,"Thank you, Andrew. I have learnt a lot of valuable concepts in last two months. I highly recommend this course to whoever is looking to start their Machine Learning journey. Andrew Ng does a wonderful job of explaining complex concepts in a very easy manner. When I started I was in doubt to pursue Machine Learning. But this course gave me a very big confidence that I can actually learn this technology. Great content, simple explanation, a must take course for all the new machine learning enthusiasts.  ",5
1633,"I think
this class provides an excellent founding in the general area of machine
learning and has provided me an appreciation of the breadth and depth in the
subject I was not aware of before.",5
1634,"The course was very well structured and covered many different ML techniques. I though think that it is bit old now. Apart from that, I would have preferred to some time devoted on developing actual machine learning system from ground up which could be deployed in cloud.",5
1635,"I think the course was really helpful in terms of the diversity of topics and techniques being used in this area of AI.  Sometimes the same diversity felt overwhelming since there is a lot of information to be assimilated.  In general terms, all the topics were covered with the right depth to understand and have a very good idea of the inner working.
",5
1636,"A very well structured course. Extraordinary teacher for the clarity with which he explains complex issues. The quizzes and practical works measure very well the learned knowledge and are very useful to reinforce the received knowledge. It is an introductory course to ML, with detailed, low-level topics on mathematical concepts and algorithmic techniques to develop ML solutions. Recommended but not indispensable that you have knowledge in linear algebra, differential calculus and probability theory.",5
1637,A very good panoramic veiw of the field of ML. Suitable for the absolute beginner who is not affraid of coding and math.,5
1638,I definitely recommend this course for whoever is interested in machine learning field. The course is taught well and everyone can follow it easily. The quizzes are also well designed so it makes you think deeply and gives you insight of what a machine learning expert should know. I wished this course could cover Convolutional Neural Network as well as it is becoming a promising method in nowadays problems. The programming assignments are also easy to follow and you will learn a lot thru doing them.  ,5
1639,"Professor Ng makes this extremely powerful tool of machine learning amazingly accessible. I did this course in my mid-fifties & it wasn't easy to work through all those programming exercises  (..performing the mental gymnastics necessary to visualize & manipulate matrices in your head), but am now rewarded with not just a clear understanding of the capabilities of machine learning (which is why I initially started this course), but think I will actually be able to try it out on some simple problems.  ",5
1640,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. The course is specifically suited for beginners. So If something you read or heard raised your interest in machine learning and wanted to learn it, this is the perfect introductory course for that. It was a pleasure to learn from Andrew Ng.",5
1641,This is an excellent Machine Learning online course and I highly recommend this to those of you who are mathematically inclined to take this course as a good theoretical introduction to even more complex machine learning topics that you'd like to study in the future. I'm grateful to Dr. Andrew Ng for creating such course and I'm thankful too to the many mentors who assisted in the discussion forums. I just completed the course today and it's been a challenging but fruitful online course experience! ,5
1642,This course is brilliant! This course clearly explains the mathematics that underpin the machine learning algorithms. Coding out the algorithms in matlab/octave is a great way to deepen you understanding of the algorithms. The course also includes lots of invaluable advice on machine learning in practice ie how to choose which algorithm and what to do next. Its all delivered in a clear and friendly manner by the legend that is Andrew NG. If your interested in machine learning this course is a must!,5
1643,"This is my first dive in machine learning, and I am glad I found this course as my first course. The instructor is very meticulous and explained things well. Especially good are the programming exercises for each week. What I found is that no matter how much I think I understand the concepts presented in the lecture videos, it's not until after I completed these exercises do I have a true grasp of all the nuances. Overall, an excellent course for anyone who wishes to get into machine learning AI!!!",5
1644,"Fantastic course. I found it both fun and instructive. The pace was good, and I felt that we were covering a good breadth of material in a reasonable amount of time. The homework was helpful to reinforce the concepts learned in the lectures. The choice of tool and sections of code to develop were done well to not waste too much time 'in the weeds' of some programming language, but to learn the material.",5
1645,"I am very satisfacted am happy of participating in this course, to learn new concepts and the state of the art in data procesing. I absolutely recommend this course to anyone who deeps in data analysis.",5
1646,"I have enjoyed this course and I believe I have been able to learn some stuff. This is not easy, I mean, the subject, Machine Learning, have many details but, Professor Andrew Ng is a GREAT teacher, he explains clearly what is and how to deal with machine learning issues and problems. If you decide to go through this course, no doubt you will learn and also, you will enjoy it. Thanks to Andre Ng, the Stanford University and of course, thanks to coursera for make this course possible and available!",5
1647,"The course was very well structured and it mainly focused on the way how the algorithms are implemented rather than just putting a ready made function into use, which was perfect as far as I was concerned with my requirements. The programming exercises were a bit too much on the easy side, I guess, which was such keeping in mind the level of majority of the students.",5
1648,"I haven't done much maths or coding in 20 years, but was able to follow this course at the recommended pace, and found it very well laid out. ",5
1649,"For me this was the perfect course! I enjoyed it a lot and learned even more. U can feel the passion of Andrew NG. After completing this course you have alot of powerful tools. Also he covers alot of topics which gives you the knowlege of which algorithm to use on different probelms. Acually i learnt so much, that i could never write all the gains in this small review.",5
1650,"This Course blew up my mind. Andrew  is a excellent teacher, he explains things in a way that makes them easy to understand and connect all that you learn into real life problems.",5
1651,"I really enjoy a lot, and sometime suffer a little bit with practices ;), learning Machine Learning principles and practices.  The material and videos are really valuable as well than, the most valuable, Andrew Ng videos teaching all concepts and taking the virtual hand of all students in this amazing visit at one of te most promising practical aspects of AI up today.",5
1652,"This course is a highly valuable one. It has been organized extremely well. The instructor provides a lot of motivation around Machine Learning and its uses and explains everything in a very simplistic way that even a non Linear-Algebra expert can understand. Furthermore, there were also mentors that had been really helpful by responding to questions and providing unit tests and test cases for the programming assignments in order to make the debugging an easier task for those attending the course.",5
1653,A great introductory course for anyone wanting to learn the basics. Andrew is a very good teacher and explains all the concepts really well. It is surprising that all the things in the course are still relevant in present times. The machine learning applications that you learn in this course demystifies how most of the tech in your smartphone OS works. I did the assignments of this course in Python which is much more used nowadays by Machine Learning experts and learned a lot of Python on the go.,5
1654,"The world's best course for the ML.  This course not only teaches you the concepts but also will make sure to make you an expert in those concepts by asking tricky, challenging and real-world problems-based quizzes and programming assignments.. so that at end of the course you will become a real expert in the subject.   I really enjoyed this course.  ",5
1655,Awesome course. I found it very informative and useful. The programming exercises were incredibly well thought out and I could tell they took a significant amount of work to put together. I did not use the help forums very much. I found most of the exercises straightforward enough to complete without help plus the forums are almost too large to find answers to questions I have. I also would've appreciated more calculus but I understand it's an introductory course. Thanks for the great experience!,5
1656,"This was more of a refresher than a discovery for me - which might influence my perspective a bit. In my opinion the class gave a quick overview of basic tools and concepts, with clear explanations and practical comments, and very low technicality. The programming exercises are fairly accessible, and to the point. In particular the ""best practice"" advice given throughout seems insightful and practical, which makes it particularly valuable, even to non-entry-level students. Definitely recommended.",5
1657,"This is one of the most exciting course i have ever taken on Coursera, Andrew Ng is the kind of Professor and teacher i never had. The way he explains concepts and ""intuitions"" is amazing, content presentation is superb! I Hope to build on all he has thought and continue to better myself and humanity! After going through this course i can certainly say I am indeed a machine learning expert in just a few months. Thanks to the very excellent Prof Andrew Ng, the great TA's and my fellow ML students! ",5
1658,I was interested to know about Machine Learning and fortunately came to know about this course from a friend and I have never looked back after undertaking this course. Andrew Ng is like the demigod of ML it seems :D . The course has been designed so beautifully and so precisely that I hardly think that someone is going with any sort of doubt after pursuing this course. I wish every other course on this planet would be designed in this fashion. Wishing for many more such course to come. Cheers!!!,5
1659,"The course gives very detailed in formation on how machine learning actually works. The real life examples presented during the course and also worked with in the programming assignments, give a pretty clear picture on how our daily life already is enhanced by machine learning functionalities.",5
1660,"The instructor, content, and interactive style of this online course are excellent.  I enjoyed the challenge of vectorizing all the algorithms.  I liked that I could watch lectures and take quizzes on my phone if I was away from my computer and had some free time.  Andrew did a great job of mixing in a lot of practical advice for evaluating and improving ML algorithms which is very important.  Andrew is a wonderful scientist, a practical engineer, a super teacher, and a great humanitarian indeed.",5
1661,"Thanks for giving lessons on such an interesting and insightful topics. It's a great and well-structured course with both conceptual theory and practical exercises that helps students (or at least me) to better understand the ideas and knowledge of machine learning. Though I didn't really participate in discussion in the forum, I think it's a good platform for interactions and support. It's also impressing to have a voluntary tutor who is responsive to the inquiries raised by others.",5
1662,"Out of all the courses I have done on Coursera, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course is head and shoulders above the rest. He paces himself well, and explains very clearly, both for those who learn better with formulas as well as those who learn better with intuition if you don't get the numbers. A lot of the examples used are from real life and not just hypothetical ones which spice up the lessons. A lot of effort has been put into this, and it shows. Definitely one of the best courses out there.",5
1663,"This is a very good introductory course to Machine Learning that covers many different algorithms for a variety of applications. Not only does it approach the subject in a simple and intuitive way, it also provides very good advice for implementing and running these algorithms. The programming assignments are well done and, through the use of provided code, allow you to glimpse at interesting applications of machine learning without having to spend too much time on boilerplate/preprocessing code.",5
1664,"It is an excellent course. Professor Andrew Ng not only explains the main concepts behind some techniques, but discuss a lot about implementation and debugging issues. If you're looking for a first course in machine learning, I'd recommend it. Of course, like it's a comprehensive course, it should be complemented by specific courses, reading and practice. Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng, Coursera, Standford University and all the staff and people that gave me the opportunity to learn this subject.",5
1665,"At first, I thought that the material is rather shallow and that the course might therefore not be useful. I maintain that the material is rather shallow, but I have come to think on the contrary that the course is very helpful. It contains lots of practical tips, and it introduces things at just the right level and in just the right amount of time to get an overview and intuitive grasp of key concepts. It provides an excellent springboard to gain more in-depth knowledge through other resources.",5
1666,teaches the very fundamental in a intuitive way,5
1667,"super good -- my friend with an BA in Machine Learning and CS said he learned more in this Coursera course than in 4 years as an Undergrad ... of course, knowledge probably sinks in over time too so maybe the undergraduate degree helped lay the groundwork for getting a full experience from this course.",5
1668,I have really liked this course. It is nice to see every week a new tool for optimisation or machine learning. The assignements are just perfect and hellped me a lot to understand completely what I was doing. It also gives me a code that I plan to use for my projects.,5
1669,I studied Comp Sci (HKUST) in my country but I didn't have the chance to take the course at that time. Andrew has been a very great teacher to teach the basic stuffs of machine learning. ,5
1670,"Simply awesome content provided in this course. It starts with the slow dose of understanding machine learning but at the end it covers most algorithms. Exercises are well designed too, however I expected it to be completed developed by student rather than partially pre-cooked, but no complains. Go for it if you wish to have a career in machine learning. One more thing to note is there is no ""R"" programming concepts covered so may be you can opt for other courses separately or learn on your own.",5
1671,"This is a wonderfully taught course. The lectures are clear, well-organized, and engaging, taking full advantage of the online format. The homework assignments take care of a lot of the legwork of machine learning for you (particularly data loading/cleaning) and let you focus on implementing the core algorithms. It's a powerful feeling to implement the heart of a neural network from scratch.",5
1672,Even though course was recorded around 2011 (I think) the methodology seems relevant to today's industry. It is hard to get started as you are introduced to new ecosystems you may not be a part of such as Octave or Matlab. It's especially problematic if you choose to use Octave as the course version is no longer open for download. I suggest finding a way to obtain Matlab for this course otherwise it'll be troublesome to keep up with assignments. But other than that it really is worth your time.,5
1673,"Thanks a lot Sir !!!!! Really Thanks a lot for making such a beautiful content of Machine Learning. The way you taught, the methodologies you used, the pace, the assignments, the quizes really all were just tailor made. I can simply assure you that I will never forget what I have learnt from this course throughout my life. Thanks a lot Sir for being such a beautiful teacher and for making Coursera, because of your team I was able to complete this course with Financial Aid !!! Thanks a lot Sir !",5
1674,"I am so happy to take this course even since the class had been launched many years ago. Andrew is really a passion and nice lecturer that people like me can easily get to know some hard ML theorems step-by-step. In the last video, Andrew said that 'I hope that you find ways to use machine learning not only to make your life better but maybe someday to use it to make many other people's life better as well. ' . I can't agree more and truly recommend all of you whom are interest to the AI trend.",5
1675,It's a very interesting course in which i learned and refreshed a lot of things about Statistics and probability.,5
1676,My first interest in AI and machine learning was 20 years ago.   And I followed some classes that time.  The level of this course was so much higher and so much understandable.,5
1677,Very good time and energy investment.,5
1678,"A great course to start Machine Learning. The theoretical concepts are very well explained, starting from the intuition and going to the practical recommendations of a professor who is a reference in the field. The course comes with programming exercices in Octave/Matlab that are quite fun to do. These exercices give you a nice set of tools with which you can apply Machine Learning to your own problems. Thank you so much for offering everyone the chance to learn Machine Learning with Coursera !",5
1679,This course is extremely good for anyone looking to get a solid basic understanding of machine learning concepts. Especially the course not only the covers the ML concepts but also gives the required intuition/ enough details on the Maths portion as well to better understand and implement them ourselves.  The amount of effort/experience the instructor has put/have in the course is commendable and  also generating interest for the students in the subject which is a hallmark for a great teacher.,5
1680,"I started this class with zero knowledge of what machine learning was in practical terms. I found the class progressing naturally through the different concepts and aspects of of machine learning, keeping the content interesting and relevant. I loved the challenge of the quiz and assignment. I find myself wanting to know more and find ways to apply the new concepts to new problems and also to old problems to see if what I learned can solve them in a better, smarter way. ",5
1681,"I really enjoyed the course, found it interesting and it was impressive how good foundational machine learning knowledge could be built up over what is actually relatively few hours work. The programming exercises I thought were an excellent way to ensure that the student has to think through the implementation of the algorithms etc. I would have liked to have learnt how to do some of it in Python, but appreciate how Octave was able to let me focus on the problem at had more than the language.",5
1682,"This is an exceptional course on the topic. Andrew Ng is a fascinating, marvelous teacher who communicates very well to students. His sole focus is teaching students about the topics, and not to impress his peers. This makes the course extremely effective for imparting very important concepts and ideas to students. In this course, not only basic concepts are covered, but useful information is provided on practical applications. This is, by far, the best introductory course in Machine Learning.",5
1683,This course was really helpful in gaining the basic concepts of Machine Learning. It gives the concept ideas at the basic level and at the same time encourages the students to develop their own applications. It also points out many prioritizing details in every algorithm where the developer should be focusing on for better performance of his/her application.,5
1684,"An amazing course. The way Andrew has structured the class, the way he gives intuition and steps forward from simple to complex ideas in a systematic and meaningful way is exemplary. I have had additional clarity on many simple computational concepts that I thought I knew. This is my first machine learning class, and I feel like my fundamentals in this field has become rock solid, much better than many classes I have taken in college and grad school. Thanks, Andrew. Highly, highly recommended!",5
1685,"This course on machine learning is a great learning experience. A wealth of topics is presented in a way that combines intuition, concepts and practical examples. Mathematics are treated, however without being made critical. Programming assignments fit well with the videos, are supportive in understanding the details, and if you like, allow to experiment with the learning mechanisms. A perfect starting point to embark for more. Andrew Ng and his team have done a great job! Thank you very much.",5
1686,"Truly exceptional and life-changing course. Highly analytical at times, and very in-depth and mathematical explanations. But for someone who can handle all the notations and math (mostly linear algebra and optimization algorithms), this course is an ideal introduction into the concepts of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised & Recommender Systems, as well as diagnostic tools). Finally, the professor is very likeable, and covers all possible aspects and questions during the course videos.",5
1687,"As I am currently a student and I cannot waste any time going around and trying out material which might not be appropriate, so I did some research to reach this course and I am more than satisfied with what I got out of it. This course not only gave me a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge but motivated me to dive deeper into the field. The excerises are a good confidence booster and I am very sure there couldn't be a better course to start my journey in the field of machine learning. ",5
1688,"This course has been an AWESOME introduction (yet much deeper than just an introduction) to machine learning. Andrew Ng is an outstanding instructor and person - he's easy to understand, develops top notch content with careful attention to detail, and is truly inspiring. I intend to complete his newer deeplearning.ai courses through Coursera as well. I encourage anyone with a determination to learn machine learning to start with this course - it'll put your well on your well toward your goal!",5
1689,I completed this course before joining my masters at one of the the top institute in India. This helped me a lot to understand my campus course on pattern recognition. Andrew's lectures helped me to visualise the concepts without breaking my head on math equation. This methodology along with coding exercises and other in-depth  references eased me to understand the math. I would recommend this course as first course to any beginner in Data science/AI. My UG background stream is Biotechnology. ,5
1690,I started this course with nearly zero knowledge of ML in this course with many doubts over my abilities but the way this course has been designed and the way Andrew sir teaches this course has made me confident that I can go on learning further in this field. The course instills confidence and forms the perfect base to delve deep in various aspects of Machine Learning. Assignments are designed in a way that we get to learn procedurally how machine learning sytems are developed and analysed.,5
1691,"Extremely satisfied with the course. I consider this as a stepping stone and a huge boost to my ambitions to make the world a better place. Andrew Ng has structured the course really well. Though I had some background in engineering and programming, the course was tough enough to keep me intriguing. But I strongly believe any one with minimal exposure to engineering can learn this advanced stream of knowledge. I had real fun learning the course. THANK YOU Andrew Ng! THANK YOU, Coursera Team!",5
1692,"Having taken other courses, in retrospect, this course was exceptional in terms of what was taught and the depth of coverage.  I feel this course was essential to my journey toward ML understanding and giving me a strong base to build from.  I found several of the programming assignments exceptionally difficult due to my thin understanding of linear algebra and how to vectorize something I'm accustomed to doing in a for-loop, but the experience was very good.  I highly recommend this course.",5
1693,"Dear Mr. Andrew Ng,I sincerely thank you for disposing such a wonderful course. I am an avid reader, so I read a lot of topic from lot of sources. This is the best that I ever had. Explaining such a topic in such a lucid manner, talks a lot about your expertise and ability to pass the knowledge of complex topics in a easier way.I loved this course, and recommend this to every one who want to kn ow the crux of machine learning.Thanks you once again!Yours StudentSambit Dash - Bhubaneswar,India",5
1694,This course is really useful in grasping the basics of machine learning to help us move forward and branch out to find more areas to explore or to go deeper into a particular course. It is taught by an excellent teacher with the utmost patience to clearly delineate and explain concepts in such a way that we understand perfectly and cannot forget. This course has given me a strong foundation in Machine Learning and is yet not too hard to follow and apply. It is my favorite course on Coursera.,5
1695,"very thorough, well divided into small topics, very well explained.",5
1696,"A great course for beginners in machine learning, explains the main concepts but with sufficient detail so that you can afterwards try out something on your own. Andrew Ng is very enthusiastic and motivated me to dig further into various aspects of machine learning mentioned in this course. Also a very good course to get an overall ""intuition"" about how to start and where to go next when developing a machine learning algorithm. Would definitely recommend to everyone interested in this topic.",5
1697,"I really enjoyed the course, and I feel I now have a better grasp on machine learning, how the algorithms work, how to apply them and how to go about choosing specific algorithms or what to spend my time on.",5
1698,"The course was a wonderful introduction to ML and demystified the technology for me. Prog Ng has a great way of simplifying concepts and identifying what areas are too complex or ""beyond the scope of this class"" to ensure a well rounded understanding at the end of the course. Tom Mosher was extremmely helpful and I was really grateful for his quick and helpful replies to questions posted on the forum. ",5
1699,"This is an amazing course for anyone of engineering or scientific background who wants to learn what machine learning is. The material in the course is easy to understand and it is presented in the most practical way, avoiding detailed mathematical proofs where advanced algebra is required. I wouldn't recommend it to broader audience though as some math background is required to put together all the details learned in this course. I would like to thank Andrew for a great learning experience.",5
1700,"Andrew Ng is literally the best teacher I have ever known. He makes the whole course comprehensible even for a foreigner and newbie like me. Also, the discussions's assistants are extremely dedicated to help. I remember that I was stuck at my first time using MatLab, but as the discussion has the tutorial of the first programming assignment, I now understand vector and matrix multiplication that I have never ever confronted before. I'm 100% looking forward to finishing this course perfectly.",5
1701,"Es un muy completo y bien explicado, incluso con material complementario adecuado que hace que puedas aprovecharlo, como el repaso de algebra lineal, el manejo y comandos de octave o las explicaciones sobre el tema de estadísticas. No solo se aprenden los algoritmos, también a seleccionar el adecuado para cada caso ,como optimizarlos, e incluso con que problemas nos podemos encontrar y como tratar con ellos. Además la forma y la paciencia para explicar son muy adecuados para un nivel medio.",5
1702,"Great overview of machine learning. I learned a lot. After this course, I think I now understand most of the popular algorithms in ML. However, to understand in greater detail, I need to go back to further improve my math and retake this course in near future. Although my goal is not to be ML developer or researcher, I believe I need more than simply apply scikit learn. This course is a very nice starting point, and also a great resource to come back again and again to pick up what I left..",5
1703,"Thank you Andrew Ng for teaching this course, this is the best course which I have ever taken. To be honest, at first I just wanted to take it to see what it is and I did not think that I'm gonna love it since I thought it's really complicated to learn and work on. However, the way you taught is very clear and understandable, have changed my mind and filled all the gaps in my knowledge, made me falling in love with Machine Learning and AI. Working on AI will be my next career! Thanks again!",5
1704,This is an excellent introduction to machine learning techniques. The lectures are very well explained and organized. I particularly enjoyed the programming assignments: they are not extremely difficult but at the same time they provide the student with the key difficulties we might face at the beginning of defining machine learning algorithms. ,5
1705,"Professor Ng is extremely clear. His lectures are extraordinarily well-organized, thoughtful, and clear. The assignments are interesting, relevant, and not too difficult.
",5
1706,"I've only made it through the first three lessons, but I can already tell you there is a TON of information in this course. It's a bit hard to keep up, but if you really invest your time you can learn a lot. The course is well designed and the balance between learning and assignments is a little heavy on learning, but still quite good. Very demanding, but in a good way! ",5
1707,"Professor Ng is an excellent teacher. To be honest, I am still finding it hard to remember all the machine learning concepts and ideas after finishing the course. But it is Andrew's ways of explaining these stuff that motivate me to think a lot about machine learning. I hope Professor Ng will continue making more courses about machine learning, AI and deep learning. I would like to say thank you to Professor Ng for this course and all of the contribution that you have made to the community!",5
1708,"This class was an excellent introduction to machine learning and its applications. I took this online course along side a machine learning course at my University as a form of supplemental learning and I feel it was really well done. For those considering this course, Linear Algebra is not necessary for completing the course but I highly recommend learning Linear Algebra first because it is really foundational to the algorithms taught and can give you a better understanding of the content. ",5
1709,"Fantastic course and a great teacher. The course lets you work on the basic idea of machine learning, all the linear algebra aspects without worrying about writing code. This is not the first course on ML I took, but this is the one where I learnt a lot about the theory and applications. The joy of not worrying about a bug in the code is real. Matlab/Octave is a good platform to beta test your idea. And then, lets code! Thank you Prof. Ng and Coursera for the content and financial support.",5
1710,"Professor Ng is brilliant at transferring knowledge and I truly consider myself lucky to be able to listen to his lectures. The course represents a solid foundation from which you can further pursue what interests you in the machine learning world. Professor Ng does an excellent job at building one's intuition regarding the inner workings of a presented technique, an intuition that will later most certainly help solve more complex problems. Overall - outstanding course, worth every minute.",5
1711,"I really enjoyed that course on Machine Learning. The pace is very convenient for people already busy working:  The videos last about only 15 min, the exercises and quizz are immediately related to the content and not too hard. It covers the main topics of supervised and unsupervised learning with useful interesting tips for these that need to use them. I was just a little disappointed that the final certificate does not put the grades since I did my best to always get the maximum score :p",5
1712,You probably are here because all those people who said that this course is the must-have of machine learning. That's 100% true but here is the hard truth:,5
1713,This course is awesome. I have learnt many stuff of machine learning from this course. If you want to start with a machine learning I recommend this course for you. You do not need to be an expert programming but you still can pass the course. ,5
1714,"Very interesting course, I was a bit worried that my linear algebra skills would be too rusty but there are optional lessons to refresh or teach you the necessary skills. I really enjoyed Andrew's approach of not only teaching algorithms and techniques but also providing practical advice on how to select which algorithm to use, first steps to take on a project, what to do next, error analysis and etc. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in what machine learning is. ",5
1715,"I found the course quite useful. It was my first but not last step to join the machine learning world. Course's scope makes me feel now i'm familiar with lots of concepts of ML research space. It was also easily understandable, and also not hard to deal with even for some specific lessons that required a bit attention.",5
1716,"Through the
course, Dr. Andrew Ng. is not only very precise in giving concrete applications
about real problems, but also in an extremely didactic way, details of
mathematical theory behind the most used algorithms, which is a real conceptual
value added for facing new problems.",5
1717,"Wonderful course. I totally recommend it. Andrew Ng really helps us through a lot of usefull and fascinating content in a extraordinarily manageable way. I was impressed with how much I learned. The most effort was with the programming assignments, in which you have to actually work a little to get things done, but it really builds confidence after you do it. I really feel that I am able to tackle reasonable machine learning projects after taking this course. A definitelly 5 stars course.",5
1718,"I realy enjoyed the course , almost evrething is explained well . The teacher always gives intresting insight into the subjects . The programming excerices are well explained  , and youre always given the tool to tackle them properly . Thank You andrew the course staff for youre great work . ",5
1719,I absolutely loved this course. Andrew Ng is a great educator; by week 2 or 3 he already made it to my personal top along Eric Grimson and Robert Sedgewick. The topics covered were extremely interesting and the programming exercises concise and to the point. I just can't thanks Andrew Ng enough for making this course.,5
1720,"It is clearly the finest course available on Coursera. The best introductory course on Machine Learning available online. The syllabus is very well designed and the instructor makes the course interesting and engaging. The large number of quizzes help us keep track of our understanding and the programming assignments provide excellent hands-on experience on very interesting problems. All in all, taking this course was a wonderful experience for me. A must for all aspiring Data Scientists.",5
1721,"I found the course to be taught exceptionally well. Andrew is clearly passionate about ML as well as educating the masses about it. The use of real-life examples is a fantastic learning aid, in the videos and in the programming exercises. I enjoyed learning Octave and performing the weekly homework; the exercises showed me how to perform tasks simply that would seem impossible to a lay person. My eyes have been opened and will look to future-proof my career by continuing my studies in ML.",5
1722,,5
1723,"Great course, good overview over the most interesting topics of machine learning with the possibility to try them out with your own code.",5
1724,I have enjoyed this course very much. ,5
1725,"The course gives a very good intuition on the statistical algorithms that are used effectively in Machine Learning programs. Being a programmer myself, not stressing too much on programming concepts and laying good foundation for statistical understanding is a plus. Statistics is a vast area which one can't master in just couple of months. Being aware of that, Andrew just stresses only on the foundational concepts that makes this a good introductory course for Machine Learning aspirants.",5
1726,"This was my second machine learning course (first certification). I enjoyed the whole experience. It has mini quizzes during a lecture to keep you glued to the topic, a quiz and a programming exercise ",5
1727,This course will lift from a beginner with no knowledge on ML to a confident person ready to dive into applying the concepts in real life after having spent around 50 hours learning analyzing and coding various ML algorithms.,5
1728,"This course allowed me to get valuable knowledge about how artificial intelligence work. It was comfortable for me to learn all necessary materials and be ready to do tasks afterwards. BTW I had great fun when learning all this stuff. This is really high quality course. I would like to recommend this course to those who is even totally unfamiliar with machine learning but who want to get the secret knowledge and be aware how this magic actually works. Many thanks to Andrew Ng, great job!",5
1729,"This is a fantastic course! I have a computational physics/chemistry background but had no prior machine learning experience. This course allowed me to gain a solid foundation in machine learning. The lectures are very well paced and the exercises and revision questions well thought out. Enough real-world context is given to prevent things from being too abstract, but the great bulk of the time is spent actually learning how to apply machine learning. Well worth the money. Thanks Andrew!",5
1730,"This is a great course! Many important supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are beautifully explained using both examples, intuition, and mathematical definitions. New knowledge is solidified and put to use in MATLAB programming exercises. Practical advise on how to diagnose and improve algorithm performance is interspersed throughout the course, together with general insights on how the things you learn are/can be used to adress real world problems, e.g. in industry.",5
1731,"Even though the course was introduced more than 5 years ago, this has been probably the most exciting, challenging, and engaging course I've ever taken online by far. It was absolutely worth my time fiddling with vectors and matrices to figuring out faster ways of minimizing cost functions and it made me realize that I absolutely love math and the usage of math to solve real-world problems as well. I am ready to jump into learning more about ML and AI technologies. THANK YOU, Andrew Ng. ",5
1732,"This class is suitable for someone who wants to know what machine learning is about. It gets a student's hands dirty on several ready-to-use tools in this domain. As a result, the student will gain tangible experience on learned skills, but won't spend too much time on the details.",5
1733,"Greetings from Singapore. Excellent course on Machine Learning. Certainly enough substance that makes this course very applicable to work on real-life machine learning problems. There is also much clarity in the teaching, on sometimes quite complex topics. Also very good focus in the programming assignments. A big thank you to Prof Andrew Ng and Stanford University for the hard work, and for making this course freely available. A very constructive and positive contribution to the world.",5
1734,"I started this course thinking that it's more of an introduction on machine learning,  but it lays down a solid foundation for us to be able to understand complex ML applications that are in use today. It drills down to the basics and pushes you to your limits.  Many a time, you're like 'Oh , this seems easy', but it's only when you get yourself to think and code that you realize that there's a lot more to the problem!
",5
1735,"This is a great course with great mentors and helpful resources. Would recommend for anybody who likes to learn about machine learning. It is just a starting point. Having good knowledge with Calculus, Linear Algebra and Satistics will help a great deal but are not mandatory. However this is not realy true if you really want to understand the formulas and concepts presented. (So: Would recommend if you learn some (at least basic) topics on calculus, linear algebra and statistics before)",5
1736,"Amidst taking this course I tried delving into other related courses such as the IBM and MIT courses for deep learning and python. Although they were great, no one conveys the depth of knowledge that Andrew NG does. He teaches the course as if you are sitting in the front of his class rather than a video taped lecture. I highly recommend this course as an introduction to the basics of machine learning and to gain insight if this is a career path or specialization that is right for you.",5
1737,"Absolute pleasure doing this course. Andrew Ng has earned the respect of everyone doing this  course for being a great master in this field who can abstract and present the complex contents in a simple way for his students to understand.  Coursera can do with many more courses by Andrew Ng.  I am a humble student and huge fan of his !  Thank you Andrew Ng and Coursera !  Thanks to the mentors (especially Tom Mosher) who jumped in to help whenever i was in some trouble !  Cheers, Viswes",5
1738,"This was my first real foray into programming, I was really nervous before starting that the programming aspect would be too difficult for me, or that I would be too inexperienced in that area to complete the course.  But after a lot of hard work and studying I'm finished!  Feeling really great now, likely going to start another one of Andrew Ng's courses but one on Deep Learning.  He's a great teacher and I'm ready to continue learning, and hope this leads me to a new engaging career!",5
1739,"Andrew Ng is really great at making the advanced subject of machine learning simple to grasp. He does an amazing job at teaching the practical application of machine learning in order to make it a solid tool in anyone's arsenal. The pace of the class was perfect for me and allowed me enough time to think through the concepts and how to apply them to my own endeavors. I ended this class feeling more motivated than I started, and I can't wait to learn, and practice more machine learning.",5
1740,"Muito contente por ter tido a oportunidade de realizar um curso online de tamanha qualidade. Posso dizer que aprendi mais com tal curso online do que com a matéria sobre o mesmo assunto que realizei no mestrado. O inglês do Andrew Ng é de fácil entendimento, o conteúdo é repassado de forma suave e com dificuldade gradualmente crescente. Totalmente recomendo, o curso já me ajudou me dando o conhecimento necessário para escrever meu TCC, e tenho certeza que será útil para minha carreira.",5
1741,"A very good course to begin the machine learning journey. Covers most of the aspects of machine learning with important algorithms as well. The good part is the course covers just enough maths required to understand the algorithms, thus maintaining the pace of the course. The course assignments are good but not all assignments are challenging. This is good for people without much programming knowledge. For engineers there should be more challenging assignments. These could be optional.",5
1742,"Great intro to machine learning if you've never done nay of it before. The course doesn't assume much previous math knowledge, but the programming assignments will be MUCH easier if you know some fundamental programming. Vectorization is especially important. Overall, great class. One comment: it is almost 2018 now, and I fear that machine learning has advanced a lot since this course was first put up. I'd love to see a few add on chapters to cover more recent developments and methods.",5
1743,The course provides clear direction and content on machine learning. Andrew conveys his ideas clearly and conducts the lecture in a good pace.,5
1744,"This is a really brilliant course. Very accessible and gets you to a point where you feel comfortable implementing machine learning algorithms, in what seems like a very short time. Some of the more mathematical explanations are sometimes glossed over, so for a very in-depth understanding you may need to read around the subject. But this course does an excellent job at making a topic, which may seem complex and out of reach, easy to understand and available to all. Thank you Prof. Ng.  ",5
1745,"This is exactly the Course I needed to get into Machine learning, before taking this course I was under the impression that a lot of ML algorithms are hard to understand, and using some libraries without understanding the underlying algorithm is the way but after listening to Prof. Andrew's clear explanations for some learning algorithms and ways to improve the performance of ML applications  I am more confident of my ability in ML and I look forward to exploring this vast area of ML.",5
1746,I'm a self-taught engineer without any academic background which means that my formal maths knowledge is under-par compared to a lot of my peers. The thing I appreciated most about this course was that by the end of it I felt confident reading the mathematical formulas that explain the algorithms and was able to code implementations based on those formulas from scratch. That feels like a real achievement for me and has given me a lot of confidence to move forward with further studies.,5
1747,"Having learned the theory behind different algorithms and data systems, I am a more confident and a well rounded thinker. When it comes to defining the insights and also correcting short-comings in the systems that are studied, Prof. Andrew Ng is methodical and clear with his subject matter. I hope that this course is as useful to students of all ages as it has been to me - I believe this is a corner stone course and a must for anyone with an interest in how data is shaping our world.",5
1748,"Amazing course! I came to it much older than most of the audience. But as a senior leader in an India KPO it is a must do to understand and appreciate the significance of ML concepts. The MAtlab is a bit of a circuit breaker but I struggled through! For those who are older ( i.e. have crossed their 40s and are into their 50s), it can be done! Its touch but the teacher is amazing and the design of the course is really clever to get you to delve into the concepts via the programming ex. ",5
1749,"Good course, which taught the basics of ML whilst giving the student time to reflect over the different applications of each algorithm. The programming exercises were a little to much of pure ""implement an algorithm"". It would have been fun to have a final assignment which was a complete system for eg. photo OCR (albeit a lot of code would need to be completed already). Just seeing such an application and implementing maybe one part of the pipeline would be interesting! Thanks Andrew.",5
1750,,5
1751,"A great course to get started with the fundamentals of machine learning , the course work is really thought out and well planned , the lectures are apt and to the point and the programming exercises are fun to do. Andrew is a great instructor who has mastered the art of delivering complex algorithm in a simple easy to understand way and his approach of taking each algorithm by problem formulation , algorithmic approach and then intuition solves all the doubts and questions one have .",5
1752,"  Overall the course is great and the instructor is awesome. Machine learning is fascinating and I now feel like I have a good foundation. A few minor comments: some of the projects had too much helper code where the student only needed to fill in a portion of the algorithm. I would have preferred to have worked through more of the code. Also, there were a few times when the slides didn't contain the complete equations so it was difficult to piece it all together when writing the code.",5
1753,"I think this a great course to learn Machine learning. I love to learn new things and ML was one of the missing one. When I was an undergraduated engineer student (many, many yeras ago), I learned some of the topics as a ""Optimization, and Math programming"". Now I see the big step develop over the years. Thanks to the Professor Andrew Ng for making simple these complex topics and motivate me to take the review questions and make the programming exercise to get a deeper understanding.",5
1754,"Outstanding course.  Professor Ng presents a substantial amount of material in a clear and engaging way. The programming assignments were challenging but great fun, and it feels great when you complete each one.   The interstitial questions that appear at times in the middle of the lectures are great for confirming that you understand a concept, or, when you get one wrong, for clarifying and adding depth to a concept so that you understand it better.   I highly recommend this course. ",5
1755,"I'm extremely happy with the machine learning course thought by Andrew Ng. If anyone start to begin machine learning then i would personally suggest to go to this course 100 assure, because you will get complete ideas about all machine learning algorithm, theoretically and practically. In my opinion this one is the best course ever in social network. One important i want to mention the course assignment is little bit complex as it is in matlab/octave, but you'll get help in internet.  ",5
1756,"Explanations were easy to understand and follow; enough information is always given to quickly understand and implement algorithms without getting too bogged down in the details. That said, it is easy to achieve deeper, more detailed understandings of algorithms/theories given the strong fundamental foundation first developed by these videos. I went from having not used Matlab in the past three years to now feeling comfortable using it to write machine learning programs from scratch.",5
1757,"This is such an amazing class, and it is perhaps even the best class I've ever taken. The professor explains each concept with such clarity and patience so that students, no matter their backgrounds, would be able to understand it. I especially loved the plenty of examples that were provided and the ""intuition"" videos, which helped me to get a better grasp of what the algorithms are doing. This course has truly fascinated me with its engaging contents, and I'm so glad that I took it.",5
1758,This amazing course starts from application and then explains how-to in a clear and intuitive way. I specially like the visualization and the assignment provided by the teaching team. I bet they must spend quite some time to create these programming exercises that not only give students hands-on experience in machine learning but also will be valuable coding assets for them in the future AI careers or projects. Learning from Andrew Ng is really a pleasure with constant enlightenment. ,5
1759,"Best Machine Learning course and instructor (Andrew Ng) on the internet! Andrew Ng's (Stanford University) Machine Learning course is very detailed and informative, and Andrew Ng explanations of all the key concepts in ML are clear and intuitive. The course videos are supplemented by short quizzes and programming assignments (in MATLAB/Octave), which solidified my understanding of Machine Learning. Overall, I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Machine Learning!",5
1760,"Huge thanks to Professor Andrew Ng, this course has taught me a lot of machine learning concepts. More importantly, they were presented in a clear and concise manner. This is absolutely the best introductory course in machine learning for anyone who has backgrounds in 2nd year college maths/CS such as algorithm, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability and statistics. This course has really opened my eyes and broadened my perspective. Again, thank you Professor Andrew Ng.",5
1761,"This course has inspired me a lot! It gave some insights into how artificial intelligence and machine learning work. Honestly, I used to be very struggling in learning something more rational. But this course was really thought-provoking and helped me learn how to analyse and solve problems in a more reasonable and effective way. It's really useful in help people with their study and careers. Machine learning is really interesting. WOW! Technology could really help change the world. ",5
1762,Excellent course! Andrew Ng is a great teacher who conveys complicated material in a very pedagogic manner. I enjoyed it and learned a lot.,5
1763,"Wonderful course! Would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in learning the basics in machine learning and willing to challenge themselves a bit. Andrew Ng does an excellent job of providing real life examples and breaking down the examples into smaller manageable steps to make learning a lot easier.  The course does require time and commitment, but if you are willing to put in the work and are dedicated to learning the material, you will get a ton out of this course. ",5
1764,"I strongly recommend this course for anyone that wants to approach the ML learning field. Andrew Ng is a great instructor, he teaches with passion and doesn't leave details unexplained. ",5
1765,"This is the best course I have found on the net to start learning on ML. The professor is very delicately carrying students through all of subject materials and he makes sure that all of pre-requisites are fulfilled prior to the next lecture.  Therefore even for someone who has just basic mathematical background can easily jump start his studies. Highly recommended. There is no other words to say, other than a big Thank you to the Course era team and the incredible professor Andrew.",5
1766,"I am amazed on myself at how much I have learned within a short span from this course. Professor Ng is awe-inspiring. His presentation kept me hooked throughout the course. He kept the excitement and interest level high, and made complex stuffs appear pretty simple. The assignments are excellent reinforcement. The toughest one is on back-propagation. Once past that, the rest of the course feels easier. Thanks a lot to Professor Ng and coursera team for putting up such a nice course.",5
1767,"It was a great course as an introduction to ML. You will definitely finish the course knowing how to apply many learning algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning. Having said this, the discussions about each of the algorithms are an introduction to each of the algorithms, not as in depth as it could have been. But still, is is an introductory course to the subject, so a later course to learn more about how to apply and modify each algorithm would definitely be appropriate.",5
1768,"Machine Learning is an excellent course with great presentations.  This is not an easy course, and I found myself reviewing concepts and being challenged to dive deeper into the material.  The assignments are difficult, but the tutorials on the discussion boards from the course mentor made all of the difference.  I highly recommend the linear algebra review as well.  I now have a much better understanding of how the machine learning algorithms work after having completed the course.",5
1769,"I am the Chinese student about this course,and this is my first course which study online.Because the Coursera.org sometime are busy, I will go to bilibili to watch the same .Very thank to my teacher Andrew Ng，and I use what I learn to finish  Graduation Project. Then I get very high marks. I believe this may not be the last class I learn on here.next I may study about making games and some lesson about ai and nerve.",5
1770,"It is the best course on Machine Learning that i have followed. Andrew Ng master its subject at the perfection and this is why he could teach this course as simple as possible without needs of complicated mathematics, clear explanations and good experiments with training exercises and more. I recommend strongly this course to someone having no knowledge about machine learning because at the end of the course it will know and master the most important things about this wide subject.",5
1771,"An excellent course for those who want to initiate on machine learning, also for those who have a degree different than computer science. Many people complain about not getting deep into math but what I did was to do the math myself, same thing with the programming excercises, you can make it as hard as you want but people from other disciplines can still complete the tasks. I think this makes the course an excellente choice. Thanks to Andrew, I really recommend him as a professor.",5
1772,"I have been working in random data analytics problems such as regression, text analytics , etc using R packages. However this course provided in depth and at the same time in very simple terms the fundamentals of these algorithms. Exercises were mind crunching and application of linear algebra - vectorization in programming was new to me. Needless to say my knowledge has increase but at the same time now my approach to machine learning problems will also change and change for good.",5
1773,"This course is a good intro in ML. It gives a good intuition what particular algorithms are doing, without heavily digging into math details (which is good for novice I think). Also this course covers a lot of practical details how to asses performance of your learning algorithm. This is very handy when you start applying you fresh ML knowledge and get some gibberish result, and don't known what to do. Professor Ng gives a good set of tools how to overcome a lot of common problems.",5
1774,"It was perfect class for me. I am not really good in math, and know only basic things, but it was enough to understand every topic in this course and also complete the programming assignments. Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher and perform all materials in very clear form, expanding complicated things in small easy to understand steps. I hope the class will be extended because it looks like ML is developing quite fast and a lot of things and interesting applications using ML come out.",5
1775,"This was a wonderful course and I am so excited to have finally completed it. With specific examples on real-world application and the hands-on learning with programming assignments in MATLAB/Octave, this course has offered a very detailed and comprehensive foundation for me. I consider this investment of time to yield far-reaching benefits in my career ahead. ",5
1776,"Excellent course for all those who would like to get started on Machine Learning.  Prof.Andrew Ng has delivered this course in great style, that even the most complex aspects are made to look very simple. Course assignments are well designed to test the real learning of the student. I thoroughly enjoyed solving those real problems. I'm confident to claim, that I'm a Machine Learning product designer now. Its a huge leap for me, personally. ",5
1777,"This is truly an amazing course and the best one I have taken online for machine learning  - Harvard's online course is a respectable second. I like the way the exercises are integrated into the coursework and are easy to submit, the Harvard method uses git and is a bit clunkier.The exercises are hard, mostly suitably hard. I like where you have to wait 24 hours to try quizzes again after three attempts. The survey of material is well designed and near perfect. Solid A for Andrew.",5
1778,"Thank you Andrew Ng for making this course, and the learning of Machine Learning so intuitive - and fun!",5
1779,"The course covers the main concepts and mathematics behind Machine Learning. The instructor is accurate and very clear in the video lessons. The quizes are very well made and help a lot to fix the content in a very good way. Programming tasks are, in most cases, challenging, making you have to review the content of the week, which also helps a lot to fix the content. I am very grateful for the opportunity to take this course and add a lot of knowledge already in my field of study.",5
1780,Andrew Ng is a great teacher. I want to thank him as he has inspired me to begin this new chapter in my life. It's a good introduction to machine learning as I am totally new to coding and computing skills but this course was really a good intro to this new era of learning and covers a wide range of topics. The programming exercises are complicated and I had to give a lot of time but going through the course and the material again and again helped me to complete them with success! ,5
1781,"Delightful course. Andrew Ng is a great teacher and delivers complicated topics on a clear, thorough  (and pleasant!) way. I can say honesly that after completing this course, I feel ready to start practicing on real world machine learning problems.",5
1782,"Very informative with clear examples and a lot of room to practice. It is really an introductory course so I can imagine that for some this course lacks depth, but if you are starting in this field; this course is great way to start and you will be able to build your first models right after week 3!",5
1783,"I found this class really interesting, well-structured and mind-opening. I want to thank Andrew Ng for teaching this class and I also want to thank the Coursera team for making learning available to anyone who finds time to give it a try. For me, personally, this class was very useful as I was able to find my first Machine Learning Internship because of it. I want to finish by saying that I strongly recommend this class to those who are curious about the field of Machine Learning.",5
1784,"Highly recommend this course. This course is at the right level of depth in explaining concepts and making you do programming assignments to reinforce the concepts. The breadth of Machine Learning concepts, algorithms and best practices  that you learn in this course is impressive. Andrew Ng does a fantastic job on leading you on to the detailed understanding of the topics. The programming assignments are challenging enough to not be trivial as well not be too overwhelming either.",5
1785,"This was my first introduction to machine learning, and I think it provided me with a good starting point from which to learn more about specific machine learning algorithms that will help me with my work. Andrew Ng did a great job explaining some commonly used algorithms and ideas, while exposing us to interesting and practical examples in the lectures that we could then work on in the homework assignments. Taking this course was an overall positive experience - I'd recommend it! ",5
1786,I was deeply impressed by the quality of this course. I really appreciated how the professor combined mathematical formalism with a practical approach into a very accurate yet accessible presentation style. I cannot imagine how much effort it took to prepare the programming assignments in a way that students had only to take care of the relevant aspects of the subjects without having to deal with time-consuming side tasks.,5
1787,"Excellent introductory course by a true master. Professor Ng managed to condense the subject without losing too much depth. The discussions are always accompanied by ample examples and reflections from a practioner's view. The programming exercises are especially valuable for finding relevance of the concepts to real-world applications, which are both fun and challenging. This course is a door-opener for people who want to explore the landscape but not wish to be put off by statis",5
1788,"Andrew is really a great teacher. Every topics covered in this course are very interesting. They are all well presented and a clear picture can be built after listening to the explanation by Andrew. Moreover, the content of the coursework (both programming exercises, quizzes and questions during video) can also help consolidating the knowledge introduced. It was fun doing all these exercises. Hope that there will be another chance to attend your lecture and wish you all the best!",5
1789,"A really brilliant and engaging introduction to the vast world of machine learning. If someone is searching for a good starting point to get into machine learning, this is probably the best. Andrew sir's way of teaching was practical and spot on which made the whole course worth all the time invested. Along with all the theory the problems and assignments are also great to understand the implication of various concepts and their application. All in all it is a ""Brilliant"" course.",5
1790,"Perfect course for an advanced introduction to ML even for those who are not familiar with (or not remember...) algebra, matrix and coding. ",5
1791,"Professor Andrew Ng's course is very structured, well explained and rhythmic. The course is probably too tough if you don't have some algebra knowledge, as no time is spent on explaining the basics. If you're not totally comfortable with algebra concepts, symbols or logic, you'll need to do some studying on the side. I loved the quizzes in each video, along with the end of week quiz + coding assignments. Great way to make sure you're mastering both the theory and the applications",5
1792,"Over the past year, I searched through the internet so much to find some good answers and good educational programs and learned very little. But Andrew Ng really put every concept related to the previous one and in the simplest form possible that you can understand and also provided material for ones who want to dive deeper into one specific program. Also, I have to say thank you to all the great mentors of this class who respond in a few hours and make understanding much easier.",5
1793,"Passionnating course, with extremely clear teaching from Andrew Ng.  Another  good thing about the course  : it is grounded on the machine Learning theory and this enables the student to get a real understanding of what each Learning algorithm does and why.  It is nevertheless fair to admit that this course is not accessible to all the public as it requires a minimum level in maths ( linear algebra).  Precisely, I got the impression to go back to my youth and some nice memories !",5
1794,学习到了：线性回归、逻辑回归、逻辑回归多分类、神经网络（forword）、支持向量机（SVM/Spam detect）、K近邻（K-Mean）与PCA（Principal Component Analysis/Feature compression）、Anomaly Detect（Gaussion Distribution/Fraud detect）与Collaboration Filter（Recommender System） 、Large Dataset（Stochastic） 等，还通过octave完成了课后复习学习与考试。,5
1795,"This course provides a great introduction to Machine Learning (ML). The topics are approached with some depth and explained very clearly. The quizzes and assignments are challenging and usefull, the forums are a very good place to learn more and clear any doubts. I was able to understand several ML paradigms and respective intuition aswell as a decent background (though a further more maths intensive course may be needed). I REALLY recommend this one for everyone interested in ML",5
1796,"Excellent course with challenging assignments and active discussion community. This course has perhaps the perfect blend of mathematical rigor and appeal to real-life applications. The relatable examples and assignments clearly gives you the ""big picture"" which helps you from getting swamped by the implementational details. Couldn't have asked for a better introductory course on this topic. Thank you Prof. ANG, intend to follow up with your Youtube playlist on Stanford's channel.",5
1797,This is a great introduction course to machine learning. Coming to the class I wasn't sure if the math involved would be too complex to follow. But Professor Ng's clear explanation of the concept and intuition behind complex algorithms made them much easier to understand or dare I say enjoyable. The programming exercises are not too difficult either once you get over the first hump of familiarizing yourself with Octave or Matlab (I used Octave for the first time for this course). ,5
1798,"As a Software Engineer, who took a break of seven years for the family; it was overwhelming to get started coding and designing all over again in the field of desire. But Andrew Ng has open the door of hope and confidence for me through his intriguing way of teaching and sharing his wisdom generously in this course. I could easily complete it well before time and is very excited to start on my projects in Machine Learning. I will be always grateful to you Sir! Thank you So much! ",5
1799,I started the course as absolutely novice without having any knowledge about the field. But now I feel comfortable about machine learning thanks to the well designed assignments in this course. All the lectures are well timed and focuses on teaching the concepts.  The exercise (projects) are built on these concepts. Completing the exercises gives a lot of confidence. I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for designing such a course and giving lucid explanation on complex topics. ,5
1800,"Although I graduated in AI some years ago, this was a great refresher. If you are familiar with the material I can imagine there would be more efficient ways to catch up, but at least this is very thorough, and it might fill gaps in the knowledge you retained from, university. ",5
1801,The most impressive course I have ever had about data. It systematically guided me into data science and its fundamentals. It helped me truly understand mathematical modelling and why to use it and how to evaluate it in real applications. ,5
1802,Extraordinarily well-taught course on a potentially difficult subject to teach well.  Really focused on deeply understanding the key parts of machine learning and not just mindlessly completing exercises.  The tests were good in that they checked whether you really understood and could reason through new examples.  It did involved coding which was a fun challenge to build something that really worked.  I would love all courses to be so well-constructed and delivered as this one!,5
1803,"I enjoyed 1) applying maths to ML problems and deciding on which models to use for varying situations, 2) translating maths into code and learning how powerful linear algebra techniques were compared to iterative/ summation techniques, 3) how in-dept and heavily involved the maths were: it provided me with a better understanding of what goes on under the hood of ML.",5
1804,There are many courses for Machine Learning but this one contains all the basic concepts which are really helpful if you're really interested in research in Machine Learning. It takes from the basics to applications. Do do not need to be a programmer or anything to take this course. You can start it without any knowledge about programming or Machine Learning. The basic mathematics is enough. I would strongly recommend this course before taking any other Machine Learning course.,5
1805,"Gaining Knowledge from this is the easiest part of this course, best course to learn theoretical knowledge about machine learning and to start with basic as well as advance topics of machine learning, but this course does not contain much of statistics stuff which is must for data science but i get that this is the course for machine learning so only machine learning stuff is there.",5
1806,This course is definitely a kickstarter for those who want to start their career in Machine Learning. The content of this course is great and designed in a manner that a non statistic background person can also learn without any complexities. And of-course learning from a great data scientist - Andrew Ng itself is a fortune. Many thanks to Andrew and Coursera for making this course and I am sure that my review will help the Coursera's recommender system get more intelligent. :),5
1807,"I think this Course is a great introduction of Machine Learning. It's suitable for the new learners who are interested in learning machine learning. And Andrew Ng wisely designed the course, distinguished the mathematics and machine learning. So I can study it without reviewing the mathematics specially. I must thank you TA and the members of forum. They helped me a lot, and provided so many materials and clear introductions. All in all, It's a great exploration. Thank you all.",5
1808,"Honestly, This is the best MOOC I've taken in my life, and this course has helped me to understand what machine learning is, how you use it yourself, and many advice on applying machine learning.",5
1809,,5
1810,This course is simply amazing! This course is great for someone who wants to get started with machine learning and go to intermediate depth. Andrew Ng does a splendid job explaining the core concepts of machine learning. I would highly recommend this program for someone who wishes to learn about machine learning.,5
1811,"This course on Machine Learning has helped me to a great extend. From learning deep theoretical crux of the core Machine Learning Algorithms to its large scale practical implementations and approaches this covers every aspect. It's one of the best course I've ever attended online. The programming assignments did cover a wide variety of applications. At last, I would like to thank Andrew Ng, to make me more interested in Machine Learning and making me understand me much better.",5
1812,"This being my first Coursera course has set a very high benchmark for the other courses. This course has in-depth knowledge sharing about machine learning algorithms and the techniques to develop and implement them in MATLAB. Andrew Ag being the Professor of this course is in no sense less than the Professor of the famous TV series ""Money Heist"". He is awesome in explaining things. I really want to sit in his class in person and get to discuss algorithms with him face to face.",5
1813,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this course with a right mix of theory, wonderful programming exercises and insights on practical considerations. The Review questions (with multiple answers) were thoughtful and so was the choice of Octave/Matlab as the programming language. I also liked the sequence in which course topics were laid out and most importantly Andrew's  style of explaining things. Thank you very much for all your efforts in designing and delivering this course.",5
1814,,5
1815,"Best course I have ever taken.  Andrew is a very clear instructor, and has created an excellent learning platform for busy people who want to learn at their own pace.  Although there were times when it was challenging, it was never overwhelming, and Andrew's calm and humble encouragement made it a pleasure to complete.  A great combination of the mathematics and theory behind machine learning, and practical examples for how to apply it.  I can't recommend this highly enough!!!",5
1816,Before coming to this course I had tried the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree and a few online tutorials. None approached the subject matter in as effective a way as this one. Andrew Ng ensures that you know what the end goal is for machine learning and then guides you to proficiency. The course material and lectures are top notch. The exercises also really challenge your understanding. Last but not least the great course mentors provide invaluable supplementary assistance.,5
1817,"Fantastic Course...Smart people have the ability to make difficult things simple, this is certainly the case. The material covered is interesting and the course is structured perfectly to walk you through different stages. If you are looking into the course and have doubts ...just don't. The programing language used in the course is pretty simple and straightforward, and even if it gets complicated the tutorials have enough resources to walk you through. THank you profesor Ny.",5
1818,"This is an excellent course. Almost all other machine learning courses teach you how to utilize the machine learning libraries but this course is different. Prof Andrew Ng has taken great efforts to really explain how these algorithms work, mathematically showing their actions, implementations. Thank you so much Prof Andrew Ng and Coursera for  this course and helping out thousands of machine learning enthusiastic like me to learn the basic with robust foundational knowledge. ",5
1819,"This class was well structured with excellent notes, hands on examples to code, discussion forums, and test exams. Enough resources for someone to work their way through the material. I’m appreciative of these various resources.",5
1820,"I highly recommended this course for those interested to learn ML either for self enrichment or for work.  The  curriculum was well thought-out and the presentation is one of the best that I've experienced among other online courses that I've participated.  I learned quit a bit but more importantly, spark an interest that I am looking forward to dive deeper. I can't thank Mr. Ng enough for putting together the quality course and shared his invaluable knowledge and intuitions.",5
1821,Amazing teaching. He is explaining very high level stuffs but he explains it so well that we understand all the concepts very clearly. Excellent programming exercises which really put us to the test and solidifies our understanding of the subjects that was taught. A must course for anyone planning to take up machine learning as a career path. Thank you so much for all the information you provided and for doing it in such a fashion that I understood everything that was taught.,5
1822,,5
1823,"The course content is structured and the instructors have ensured that the student(s) understand the objectives and course content along with the programming exercises. The programming exercises are really well thought of, and in a way help the students develop their library of the basic/commonly used functions/algorithms. Andrew Ng really makes it a point to convey the complex ideas of Machine Learning in a fairly simple and neat way. Kudos to the entire team for the course!",5
1824,"I loved this course. Andrew sir is an awesome teacher. Before taking this course, I always felt that I am behind many others in the sense that I did not know much of the machine learning. But this course has helped me tremendously. It is a very good course for beginners. You have to put some efforts at times to understand the topics but overall this course is more than worth having to learn. I will suggest everyone who wants to start with machine learning to take this course.",5
1825,One of my absolute best educational experiences in my life.,5
1826,,5
1827,This is a wonderful course to start machine learning. Andrew maintains a consistent speed in explaining things which helps everyone. After finishing it I feel so much inspired to continue learning and practicing machine learning on my own. ,5
1828,"This felt like a great introduction to the algorithms being used today by the top companies and academics.  Very relevant course!  This was not meant to be a thorough course, and some of the math was glossed over, but just enough was given so that I feel comfortable going further into any topic.  This course can definitely take some time to complete, but anyone with some programming experience who's had exposure to linear algebra should be fine understanding what's happening.",5
1829,"It is not the content, but the Trainer which makes an online training interesting. Andrew Ng is that kind of trainer. Along with his exceptional articulate information sharing ability, he also provide insights from his years of practical experience in the industry during this course. He shares the Math behind each of the algorithm explained in a manner that is not overwhelming for an average student. I would 100% recommend this to either beginner of intermediate level in ML.",5
1830,It has been a great experience. this course definitely exceeded my expectations.,5
1831,"Thank for creating this class. Now I have gained a lot of new knowledge. I know how a machine can see, act, and respond as same as person, how a machine can know every thing I need when I'm surfing the internet. I'm so happy when I passed this class and I think someday I will apply this knowledge in my  life to make it better. Thank you Coursera for creating this class and thank Andrew Ng for taking time to teach me a lots interesting and helpful knowledge. Thank you!!!!!!!!",5
1832,"Without a doubt, just take this course (which is ofcourse free) if you wanna get into ML. Something might not make sense to you at first if you are new to ML, but don't worry - it happens to everyone when it comes to ML - so you are not alone. Just continue to watch videos, and do programming assignments(which are actually very easy as they only test the most important part and the rest of code is already given). Eventually you'll understand everything - Math is important!!!",5
1833,"This is a very well organized course. Starts from basics and touches the advanced topics in a way that a beginner could understand. The course doesn't assume any priory knowledge of machine learning. Little bit of calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives), logarithms(log, exp) and probability(Baye's theorem) is all the math knowledge that will be useful to better understand the concepts. Highly recommend this course for people who are just starting out on machine learning.",5
1834,"Awesome Instructor! I was afraid that I couldn't start with Machine Learning. The Instructor has made Ml a cakewalk. The Second best thing about this course (Best being Andrew Sir) is use of OCTAVE/MATLAB for programming exercises. The programming assignments expect only relevant functions to be completed by the student, that makes me feel confident about ML. Now, I can go implement Machine Learning Algorithms in other languages such as Python by myself. ",5
1835,"This was the best course I attended so far. The way Andrew taught the math is very approachable. I liked the focus on the big picture without ignoring the theoretical background. Furthermore the structure was excellent, introducing the vocabulary, put it into context and keeping up on a consistent story. The mentors (especially Tom) are extremely helpful and the provided material (slides, additional readings, test cases, tutorials) are very well done.",5
1836,"It is a very useful course that teaches so much from foundation to advanced level. I could not complete when I registered in the previous session and even in this session, I struggled with some of the modules while others were a breeze. I understand why MATLAB / Octave is recommended (prototyping speed), I personally would have preferred using Python and TensorFlow so that we have recipes for real life work. However, if there is one course that all must do in ML, it is this. ",5
1837,,5
1838,"This was an interesting and well planned overview of a wide range of topics in machine learning.  For a beginner, this course gave me a great look at the bredth of the topic. both on elements I had some experience with (SVM, Unsupervised clustering) and stuff I hadn't ever looked into before (PCA, NN).  I thought the video lectures were well made and the progamming assignments were really well targeted (even if they were a little hand hold-y).  Thanks to Dr. Ng and his team!",5
1839,"Excellent course! Well structured, covers a broad range of topics, and Andrew is a great teacher who knows how to break things down to their essential parts and how to visualize them.",5
1840,I would like to show my gratitude to Professor Andrew Ng & Stanford University for conducting this class. ,5
1841,"This course covers many aspects of machine learning: theory behind many algorithms and practise with specific exercises.  It is very good to have a first approach to machine learning systems, also for people who have a basic university background to Maths.  My positive feedback is not only for machine learning algorithm explanation, but also for adding advice  for evaluating the goodness of the final  system and improving the overall performance. That's so good in practise!",5
1842,Fantastic Course. Honestly the de-facto online machine learning course that I would recommend to people who want to learn more about the field. The programming assignments can be quite challenging at times but you can always find help with them. At the end of the day I was able to get a solid grasp on Machine Learning overall and when to actually apply it. HOW you apply it can come later. This course is a solid baseline and you should consider taking it (and paying for it).,5
1843,"This is my first course on coursera and I would like to mention that I thoroughly enjoyed studying this course. The best thing about this course is that you do not need to be an expert in programming or mathematics to understand the underlying concepts of ML. Even if you are a beginner, you can learn machine learning as Andrew will hold your hand and carry you along the curriculum and make things very easy for you to understand. One advice: try watching it at 1.50x speed :P ",5
1844,ML by Andrew Ng is the best course in my view for one those who want to start with Machine Learning. The level of understanding this course provide is great. All the assignments are good enough to play with your thinking skills. I just find it little bit boring after Week 5 but still every week is important  in their own ways. I would recommend those who is reading this that go for this course with patience and commitment to complete it and do assignments honestly. ,5
1845,"This has been one of the greatest conceptual courses I have ever taken. Specially the instructor Mr. Andrew Ng , I am truly thankful for your so much familiar behavior and language. It felt like every problem I am gonna face was already understood. Coming to the content, It was very much rich and makes someone very clear about the ground concepts. If anyone is reading this, don't go for a second thought, just go for it. Keep calm and rock it.",5
1846,I found this class to be challenging and exciting for the topics taught in it. The material was at a very comfortable level and not difficult to follow. The instructor made the material easy to digest without the need for higher level math. I am glad I took the class because I learned how the machine learning algorithms are implemented and more importantly how to vectorize them. I strongly recommend this class to anybody who wants to learn about machine learning algorithms!,5
1847,"Excellent course. I do recommend to my office colleagues. It's very important to have basic understanding on Machine Learning, as Machine Learning is more relevant today due to advent of sophisticated computer hardware and software. It not only provides basic understanding but also provides advanced one. The course materiel is very relevant to current trend and  a well thought one. The instructor is exceptionally good. I thank him very much. Thanks to Coursera and Stanford.",5
1848,This course is the perfect one for Machine learning even if you are a novice. The concepts are so well explained with great examples. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He makes things so simple to learn. The review questions and programming exercises are so well designed that one can complete them only if they have understood the concepts well. Another important aspect of this course was that there was a lot of focus on practical use of Machine learning. Thanks a lot Andrew!!!.,5
1849,"I had no prior ML experience before I took this class, but I had been a professional software developer for several years. This course is phenomenal! The concepts and practical advice are incredibly valuable in my day-to-day tasks. The exposure to Octave is also useful for prototyping ML projects with a fast feedback cycle compared to our production service. In just 10 weeks I've transitioned from being ""the new guy"" to ""the guru"" on our team's ML project. Thank you Dr. Ng!",5
1850,"One of the best courses I have ever taken.  The thought of researching / learning machine learning can be overwhelming given its heavy use of calculus and linear algebra as well as advanced programming skills; however, this course embraces expert understanding of intuition and practical application.  Having absolutely no machine learning skills before hand (some programming skills) I have been able to implement machine learning models into personal projects to great effect.  ",5
1851,this was a phenomenal course that gave me a much wider breadth of skills in machine learning that I initially had expected to gain.,5
1852,"A great and concrete  basic course  of machine learning. Dr. Ng introduced the primary (but very important) concepts and algorithms of machine learning very clearly. So if you are interested in machine learning , artificial intelligence or even big data science, I encourage you to take this course  as an intro course. However, if you want to learn deeper knowledge about this field, you should sign up an advanced course or read more books, and  learn more complex algorithms.",5
1853,"This was an excellent course for understanding the fundamentals of many supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The topics were well chosen, the programming exercises and quizzes were appropriately difficult, and the video lectures were interesting. Moreover, I appreciated the more practical aspects of developing learning algorithms (e.g., what steps should you complete to assess if you even need to collect more data?). All in all, I'd highly recommend this course.",5
1854,I'm a japanese college student of economics.,5
1855,Very thorough and step-by-step explanation for most of the math. After getting the hang of Octave the programming assignments were fun too. Thanks Prof for the course and for kickstarting coursera :),5
1856,"Great Course, Andrew Ng is a great teacher he taught his course very clearly and concisely, Every concept regarding building the base of Machine Learning is explained beautifully, although the assignments are in Octave but we can easily implement them in any programming language if we grab the concept behind it , Best part is he let's us to know how algorithms can be represent in Mathematical form and any mathematical intuition can be represent in any programming language,",5
1857,"The entire journey of this course had left an impeccable impression on the coursera's MOOC and I am delighted to be part of this community to learn from much reputed scholars and universities.Being a beginner in machine learning, this course has given me much needed insights and laid the path to venture into the vast field of AI. I thank each and everyone involved in this course for sharing their knowledge and making this course reach to every nook and corner of the world.",5
1858,"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"" - Arthur C. Clarke. For me, Machine learning had mostly been magic... until I enrolled in Andrew's course which dispelled the magic and explained the inner workings to someone who is new to this field as clearly as possible. The quizzes and assignments were though provoking and gave confidence that you too can start implementing machine learning solutions once you understand the concepts. Thanks Andrew. ",5
1859,"I have learned a lot useful inside about various ML methods, thanks for the team of this course especially Andrew Ng for this excellent work. ",5
1860,Excellent presentation from professor like Andrew - it was so much of knowledge that i had in the last couple of months - many things are still grey for me but he did it wonderfully to make me focused through simple explanation in layman's terms and that too for persons like me with little knowledge about programming and stuff. ,5
1861,"Excellent course by Prof. Ng. The course was very well designed. And is definitely recommendable for a beginner. The exercises were also well thought out, with the exercise sheets containing all details to complete the exercise.",5
1862,"Great beginner high level class for anyone that knows some calculus, linear algebra, and computer science.  Although I do wonder how connected it is to modern day techniques, I do feel like I understand Machine Learning up until a few years ago.  A lot has changed in the last 2-3 years so consider taking some kind of recent class to learn the more recent changes on A.I. like Deep Neural Networks and GANs and CNN and other modern tools/libraries/languages to work with A.I.",5
1863,Friendly course about Machine Learning. Contains a lot of concepts that you will be hearing frequently in the Machine Learning world. It covers them in a simple way that helps you to easily understand them. It is the ultimate Machine Learning 101 course. Prof. Andrew has the ability to explain somehow difficult concepts in a simplified way while being mathematically strict.,5
1864,"This course was Awesome! I highly appreciate Andrew Sir's huge effort in designing this course in such a way that it benefits us the most. I not only learnt the Machine Learning Algorithm, but also how to handle my time well while applying them. Not all courses do that! This is what makes this course stand out of the crowd. I enjoyed a lot learning from this course and use this knowledge for the betterment of me and the word around me!",5
1865,This course was exceptional. I've learned so much during this time. Thank you Andrew and all the classmates. It hasn't been to hard to pass it alongside other work that I have. It gave me a deep insight into ML and I am very pleased that I decided to take the course as an intro to AI. The professor tries really hard to be clear and understandable and the programming assignments are very nicely prepared (I was working with online MATLAB). I enjoyed it a lot. THANK YOU ALL!,5
1866,"This is the best course that will ever be created . I think there no other course and instructor like this course has. Prof. Andrew Ng breaks down even the most complex topics in a easy to understand intuitive way. I will recommend this course to every single person interested in Computer Science . Finally , Thank you Coursera for introducing this course because it has surely increased my knowledge and now I am more confident in calling myself a Machine learning Engineer.",5
1867,An ultimate  in-depth but comprehensible machine learning courses for beginners.,5
1868,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this class taught by Professor Andrew Ng. He teaches each subject matter very clearly & guides you slowly through the course. Each week leads elegantly on to the next & you gradually build upon what you have learnt so far. After many weeks of his video tutorials helping me through the late nights of study, I am sad to have to let these classes end. Thank you so much Professor Ng for teaching me something I have wanted to learn for many years now.",5
1869,,5
1870,"A practical course by a capable professor. Too simple in terms of theoretical aspects, but Prof. Ng is very good at making abstract concepts and methodologies easy to follow and understand. Great course as an introductory to Machine Learning. ",5
1871,"Fantastic course.  The pace was really good for someone brand new to machine learning.  Not slow, where it becomes boring or tedious.  Fast, where you have to pay attention, and well presented.  Challenging - the information is all there to guide you to success in the programming exercises and quizzes, but you have to make use of all the information and exercise your brain.  I feel that I learned a lot of material. Ready to move on to the next machine learning challenge.  ",5
1872,Dr. Ng clearly has a passion for equipping the next generations with the tools to understand and implement machine learning. The degree this class matters to Dr. Ng is particularly evident in the class's final video. Thank you for the guided tour and better understanding of how to implement machine learning solutions. The only thing I did not like about the course was the constant headache of trying to figure out which array/matrix was oriented in which direction (haha).,5
1873,"Un curso introductorio que abarca una gran panorámica del aprendizaje automático, indicando cómo aplicar los diferentes algoritmos y que técnicas utilizar para su depuración y afrontar los problemas que podamos tener en su ejecución. La lista de ejercicios de programación en Octave dan una excelente oportunidad de llevar la teoría a la práctica con ejemplos reales. Absolutamente recomendable. El temario es, no obstante, de cierta enjundia, y exige paciencia y dedicación. ",5
1874,"This course is extremely useful and well structured, it really went beyond my expectations and i feel to have learnt a lot though i'm sure this is only the beginning of the journey. Dr. Andrew Ng is a brilliant teacher that can explain you even the most complicated stuff in a way that you will be able to effectively understand it, though some requirements are needed especially on math and coding. Looking now to learn even more from the Deep Learning Specialization course",5
1875,"The course covers Machine Learning Basics in much much detail along with a strong mathematical foundation on which these ML concepts are laid. The course uses OCTAVE programming language, although I would personally prefer python or Julia for Machine Learning. Since I have a sound mathematical background, I could easily understand most of the mathematical concepts in this course. Overall, a very good course to kick-start the long and tedious journey of Machine Learning. ",5
1876,"It was a great journey!. I had many concepts discussed in this course ""heard"" from other colleagues but the overall information I gathered in this course make me way more confident on the knowledge I now have on this area. Also, the structure of this course was really well planned, having short videos highly focused on the different subjects, very concrete quiz and very well developed programming assignments to wrap it up every chapter (week). An overall great course!!.",5
1877,"The course contents truly cover a lot of ML concepts and are great to begin the learning. One suggestion would be if you could include exercises in python too, that would make it easier to start projects in python for us. Also, if some fun visual exercises could be included at the end of each module aside from the programming assignments, it would mame the learning process faster and more fun. Thank You to Prof. Andrew NG and Coursera and the whole team for this course.",5
1878,A lot of information has been tightly packed into this short course. Great technical background as well as some practical experience. What could've been better:,5
1879,"very helpful as an introduction to machine learning. Although some topics are not taught like naive bayes and random forests. However, the main important topics are given as well as important techniques on how to select your algorithm and how to improve it and this specific point is not available in any other course.",5
1880,"This course is arguably the best place to start for anyone who wants to learn machine learning. I've tried other approaches before, like diving head first into neural networks without a clue about other simpler algorithms like linear and logistic regression and just got confused despite having no trouble with the mathematics. This course however made everything crystal clear. And I have yet to see an instructor as good as Andrew Ng. His enthusiasm was a great motivator.",5
1881,,5
1882,"This class went over many learning algorithms, techniques to improve them, and ML decision making processes and examples. There are a few things that have happened in ML in the  past few years that have not been included and that may be intentional, we can't cover every single thing in an introductory course, but it may also be time to update a few a few of these videos to reflect on these recent advances.",5
1883,"I have passed several machine learning related courses in my University. This course explains the concept from another point of view which was interesting for me. As I study in Electrical Engineering we focus on math much more than what was done in this course. Actually this was the great positive point of this course, since many students may not be familiar with math and algebra much , and they can still learn machine learning, write their code and use the algorithms. ",5
1884,"This course ""Machine Learning"" by Prof. Andrew Ng is incredibly great,",5
1885,"Thank you very much for this course. I am pleased to have learned the necessary basics to understand and develop machine learning algorithms of my own. The course is given in a clear and structured way, which makes it very pleasant to follow. The programming exercises are extremely well done and allow to focus on the main tasks of the considered algorithms. I am also grateful for the numerous tips for debugging and improving algorithms as I'm sure they will be helpful. ",5
1886,"covers the major topics of Machine Learning. A good starting point for those who are planning to work in this field. The material is well organized and assists in understanding the concepts easily. For those who don't understand the concept clearly by watching Lecture videos and working on quizes, reading the programming assignment's PDF first would be helpful, as it describes each concept extremely well.(these were very helpful in clarifying doubts that I came across)  ",5
1887,"Andrew is a true master at machine learning, and has designed this course extremely well, covering a lot of material succinctly and also covering all the fundamental concepts very well, so that even if students like me cannot call them experts in calculus, they can still complete the course. The course and exercises are challenging at times, but well worth the effort. Thanks very much to Andrew and his team for putting together an excellent course on a complex subject.",5
1888,"This is one of the awesome online course, that I actually wanted to complete on my own, and not felt reluctant anytime during these 2 months of class duration. It helped to understand so many linear algebra and vectorisation concepts, that I could not revisit since my engineering collage days. I can confidently use some of these machine learning ideas, in my current job as a software engineer and hopefully develop new models that would be helpful for others in my work.",5
1889,"Great overview of several ML concepts and topics. Being a python fan I was skeptical in taking a course where the assignments were restricted to using octave. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by how every lecture and assignment set was explained via basic linear algebra, and was impressed by the speed and efficiency of octave's framework of  working with matrices. I also a little surprised that Random Forests and Decision tree based algos were not covered in the course.",5
1890,"I thought this was an excellent course and only have positive feedback for it. The lecture contents were interesting and well tied to exercise questions and programming assignments. The programming assignments were challenging overall but forced me to really learn the details of each machine learning algorithm. When things got a little too frustrating, such as for the neural network backpropagation assignment, the forums provided ample direction for me to move forward. ",5
1891,This is the course which made me finally dive into Machine Learning. Gives you all the nitty-gritties that are required to explore and learn this vast field and gives the direction to proceed further.,5
1892,"Thank you Professor Andrew Ng of Stanford University for your well constructed, thought provoking, eye-opening course on Machine Learning.  I was challenged by the course content, and rewarded with an understanding of the theory behind machine learning algorithms, and hands-on experience with the computer programming implementation of those algorithms.  Frequent reference to real-life applications illustrated the important contributions being made by machine learning.  ",5
1893,"Excellent course! Very well structured, starting with simple linear regression, moving on to logistic regression and multi-class classification which almost automatically leads to neural networks. Great programming assignments with lots of guidance on solving them (I highly recommend the tutorials). I also recommend solving everything with vectorized code from the very beginning. It will save you a lot of headache later in the course. Thanks for this great experience!",5
1894,"This course lays very good foundation of theory of Machine Learning along with excellent programming assignment. Further, the questions asked in quiz also really need good grasp of the concepts to pass the assignment. This adds more value to the course since solve quiz questions require  going through the slides/video again and again. May be little more mathematical  (on optimization) concept as a additional material will add more value to the course. ",5
1895,"Great course for those curious about the subject and wishing to explore what it really means. Gives an excellent overview of what Machine Learning entails, exposing students into some nuts and bolts of the programming as well (which could be a bit more intense and engaging - I found the exercises relatively easy to complete). One of the biggest benefits is the structure it provides to apply the various machine learning methodologies / tools as well as the diagnostics.",5
1896,"If you are a data enthusiast and have tried dabbling with various ML libraries for a while and are wondering if you have missed anything that is hampering you to do well, then this course is for you. Professor Andrew NG gives not just the solid foundation on Machine Learning, but will boost your confidence along the way with inspiring examples, pop-quizzes, guiding-coding-assignments and his absolute humility. Thank you Coursera for having Professor Andrew NG onboard.",5
1897,Absolutely perfect for anybody who wants to learn about ML and get familiar with all the terms and algos. The course is a bit on the harder side and you may find it difficult if you are a busy man or a student but it's worth every minute yours. You probably will only get like 30% of the course after it ends but trust me spend a few weeks self studying the course after you are done with it and you will become an expert gradually. After all practice makes a man perfect. ,5
1898,"Awesome course, with outstanding pedagogy. ",5
1899,"Thank you so much Andrew Ng. I will miss you so much..... This course is just fantastic and I got another blow of serious curiosity and enthusiasm to learn and make myself a better engineer and a software developer while doing this course. All credit goes to Andrew! His teaching methods are amazing and I myself learned a lot about teaching and how to actually learn. He is an amazing person. I wish I could help people as he does. Can't say more...Thanks again, Andrew! ",5
1900,"This was my first online course that I have completed . I was not that excited to learn ML in the beginning , some other factors motivated me to start this course but after few week I started loving ML and this course . The one who says ""Don't worry if have not understood this I will teach you later in more depth "" is the best teacher and Andrew Ng Sir is one of them . I also want to tank Sir Neil Ostrove who cleared my all doubts within an hour in discussion foroms.",5
1901,It is a Brilliant Course!! Mr Andrew has taught the course ware in the simplest way as much as possible.,5
1902,I like the way how programming exercises are guided through existing code/scripts. What we need to do is just to add the missing parts. This helps us to focus on the ways to implement key ML concepts. It also greatly reduces the difficulty. I got stuck several times but eventually I found that all programming exercises turn out to be easy in terms of the coding itself. But one just needs to know how to use the algorithms. I am likely to take more Andrew Ng's courses.,5
1903,"This was a truly magnificent course. I started it just because I didn't know what to do with all my free time. Spending time doing this course was by far the best decision I have ever made and has transformed machine learning into a viable career option for me. I would like to sincerely thank Prof. Ng for all the hard work put into making and uploading these videos. A huge thanks to the mentors too, for all the help during the programming exercises. Kudos to you all! ",5
1904,"This is a very interesting course and all the materials have a very high quality, especially the programming assingments, which are very well crafted.",5
1905,This is my first online course. I took much time for many obstacles like academics and so more. But I am now so much happy for completing this. I want to thank Andrew NG for this outstanding course and his patience to teach basics from scratch. I also want to thank Coursera for giving me the chance to have the course free of cost as I have a financial crisis going on. Big shout out for YOU. Thank you hope I will continue my journey to machine learning in the future.,5
1906,"This is a very well paced, well thought-out course that is suitable for working professionals. It assumes a basic understanding of undergraduate mathematics, but makes no assumptions about the expertise of the student beyond this. The programming exercises are brilliantly structured, and clearly the extent of thought and effort that have gone into designing them. Kudos to the team, the mentors, and of course, to Andrew for developing this course. Highly recommended!",5
1907,"The clarity with which Professor Andrew Ng explains the most complex algorithm, is like having an elder's arm around you when you walk through a scary forest at night. You feel protected, and empowered. Not to miss excellent mentor Tom Mosher who is everpresent to help people, or point them to the right tutorials or resources.  ",5
1908,"This course took a long time for me to complete due to time constraints but I feel it was very much worth it to stick it through til the end. Mr Ng is an amazing professor and I feel jealous of those who had the opportunity to receive classes personally with him. Machine learning is an amazing topic and the course really takes the time to guide you step by step, even the most complicated topics are easy to understand when they're being explained by Andrew Ng. Thanks",5
1909,"Excellent course. In my experience really good teachers are uncommon. Andrew does an amazing job of leading this class. The material reflects lots of thoughtful preparation and Andrew works through it in a very engaging manner. I found the conclusion very touching. There's a bit of that throughout the class. As to the content itself, given I'm new to ML it's hard for me to say how thorough or deep it is. It does cover a *lot* of ground and I did find it challenging.",5
1910,I would say this course is fantastic. Only the expert who truly understand something can tell that thing in such a easy and clear and organized way. Prog Ng is that expert. ,5
1911,"This is such a good course that gives a good intuition into Machine Learning.  For me it has given a new sense of appetite to learn and revisit Multivariable calculus, Numerical Methods, Probability. I hope it will trigger the same for many others too. The prof has taken a lot of effort to help us visualise Machine Learning. His efforts are truly appreciated! I would strongly recommend this course for everyone suitable and most importantly interested in the subject.",5
1912,"Andrew Ng does an amazing job explaining the mathematics behind each concept, striking a great balance between abstract mathematics and concrete ideas.
",5
1913,Very nice course! Andrew explains everything clearly and in enough details for anyone to understand. The content is very informative and gives a good coverage of ML algorithms and their applications as well as many practical pieces of advice of how to tune them or where to look for if something does not work.,5
1914,It is a perfect course to get into Machine Learning technologies. The key mathematical fundamentals are introduced while putting complicated theory behind so that you could focus on how Machine Learning works through mathematical computations. It is not only about theory but also provides you with intuition and application examples as practical advice. Do not hesitate to kick off the course and hope you see the light at the end of the tunnel by getting through all.,5
1915,"This is a super cool introduction to Machine Learning. I feel encouraged to learn more about the field. Where some professors try to emphasize how theoretically difficult their field of expertise is, I feel that Andrew makes Machine Learning feel simple and intuitive, and emphasizes how possible it is for anyone to learn Machine Learning. This is impressive, because it almost goes under the radar that this is in fact a difficult field to learn. I am very satisfied!",5
1916,"I like the way the course is outlined. The programming exercises are very well designed and are challenging. A background in linear algebra and calculus helps a lot. Having access to Octave is absolutely fantastic, as a free platform to learn the fundamentals. I liked the way Professor Ng focuses in the fundamentals and how he explains. He shares the intuition, which is very important to motivate and invite you to learn by your own. All in all, an excellent course.",5
1917,"Fantastic introduction to the field of machine learning with Prof Ng as a first class teacher. I so much enjoyed his empathy and in depth knowledge of the topics of the course. I also vastly enjoyed the hands on programming assignments, that are very well presented, and give you a lot more insight into the algorithms, as you go along with working out the solutions. I completed the course in just have of the due time, but I could simply not stop to see what is next.",5
1918,I really like the approach of this course the mentor was really good and his way of explanation was quiet impressive the course contains several features which help student to learn more effectively and questions in between videos are quit good which are helping me to understand what is the moto  of that ,5
1919,This course is the best Machine Learning course available because it teaches the algorithms in deatils and explains the mathematics involved in brief. Though this course was in MATLAB/Octave but they are very easy languages which doesn't requires much time to learn. The contents of this course is very rich in nature explained very well by Prof. Andrew Ng such that a beginner can understand each concepts very well.,5
1920,"This was one of the best decisions of my life. The docent Ng Andrew is a great teacher and it is was a pleasure attending one of his classes. he explained everything in a way you could understand it and when you didnt understand it, the forum was there to help you and clear your mind. I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn about machine learning. And that includes not only the basics, but also the steps after the basic algorithm. great course",5
1921,"Exceptional course, had great content and Andrew did such a wonderful job of not just helping us understand the nuances of different algorithms but at the same time teaching practical and useful tricks on how to approach a machine learning problem. It had the right mix of quizzes and exercises to help students understand the different aspects of machine learning and the lecture slides will always continue to be a great reference for all students in the future too.",5
1922,"My favourite course of all time! Love all the lecture videos, the challenging yet fun programming exercises, and the expertise of the instructor and mentors. I'm fascinated by every single module, which are packed with so much content, and many of Professor Andrew's unintentional jokes makes it even more fun to watch the videos. I feel so much more confident after taking this class, thank you for designing this class and inspiring me on my potential future career! ",5
1923,"Professor Ng is awesome.  I thoroughly enjoyed this course.  It is accessible to a wide variety of audiences, and allows for both those with a small amount or large amount of background in the subject matter to still gain quite a lot from the course.  Plus, the course material is highly relevant and interesting to those who wish to be a part of current and future machine learning efforts.  10/10 would recommend to anyone with even a slight interest in the subject.",5
1924,,5
1925,"Probably the best course I have ever taken in my life up to now. I'm not even talking about just Machine Learning. The quality, teaching style, exercises, quizzes everything make this course the best course ever. Andrew NG sir is extremely passionate about teaching. He knows what he's saying and he knows how to teach machine learning very well. The best part of this course is the fact that it teaches the fundamental ideas without being extremely mathematics heavy. ",5
1926,This is an interesting where you will be introduced to different Machine learning concepts and Algorithms. The programming challenges were equally interesting as well. You do need to know Linear Algebra etc but Andrew has taken care to explain the relevant details without going in too much detail about the Mathematics involved. I have really learned something new in this course and highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about Machine learning. ,5
1927,I thoroughly enjoyed learning Machine Learning from Professor Ng. He took an intimidating topic and simplified to the the point that anyone can learn it. He was always encouraging and reassured his students it is ok to not understand everything right away. The programming exercises were fun and linked the lecture concepts to real work applications. I will highly recommend this course to anyone who is serious about learning Machine Learning. Thank you Professor Ng! ,5
1928,"Very well-taught class. The weeks of classes has been organized properly so that each topic will build on top of the previous topics. Professor Andrew Ng dissects every important aspect of the topic and does not involve other topics that may not be important to learn. Instead, he states that some algorithms are already usable and optimised by other fields of specialisation and students learning this class does not need to dive deep in order to do Machine Learning.",5
1929,it's very good.This course gave me basical and overall knowledgement  about machine learning which is very helpful for my next level of machine learning. And Mr.Ng's teaches very patiently. He often makes a lot of examples to make the course easy to understand. There are  program missions about the course which i think helps me a lot. anyway thanks ，Andrew Ng.Thank you for introducing me into the world of machine learning which is fantastic and makes me thrilling.,5
1930,It has been an amazing experience to learn machine learning concepts. The complicated concepts and topics has been made simple and easy to understand by Andrew. The teaching style is very easy and most of the students will be able to grasp it. The programming assignments are very helpful for a deeper understanding of the concepts and algorithms that are discussed in the video lectures. This course has surely increased my interest in the field of machine learning.,5
1931,"If I could give this 11 out of 5 I would.  As a former programmer and instructor with over 20 years experience in IT, I have taken and taught dozens of courses.  This is one of the best I've experienced.  Andrew Ng is an absolute marvel.  He structured the course and material extremely well and explained it all masterfully.  The unsung heroes of the experience for me were the moderators.  The forums were so helpful, especially for the math challenged like myself.   ",5
1932,"Hands down the best course I've taken so far. Professor Ng is one of the most enthusiastic and passionate people I've come across in the field of Machine Learning. He simplifies complicated ML algorithms and for people with lesser mathematical background, he also explains the various ideas intuitively. The support staff is excellent as well and the programming assignments are well designed to help you get an understanding behind the mechanism of these algorithms. ",5
1933,,5
1934,"A really great introduction to Machine Learning, with accessible and understandable concepts introduced in a way that I can grasp both the mathematics and the intention behind them. Some of the Programming examples are challenges, but they need to be to ensure that you understand the subject matter, but all of them work well once you have completed them.  Andrew Ng is an engaging teacher and I'm very happy to have done this course and will recommend it to others. ",5
1935,Currently I am taking this course. So far it has been very good. All the Assignments I try to do it on my own with out referring to much of the hints. It gives 100% clarity on various algorithms once completing the assignments. Over all very very good course for beginners. For who look for mathematical rigour this is not the course as it is more of implementing the end expressions using Octaves. More useful for IT engineers who work in companies than Researchers. ,5
1936,Awesome course!!,5
1937,"Compared to the Temple University ML course I attended, it is better taught, especially in the programming part.  The purpose of the course here is to teach you something and give you enough to work with, not that you come prepared and just show off what you learned elsewhere. It also teaches a number of  interesting ways of looking at problems that I have not thought of before, so a big thank you to everyone who made courses tike this one available to everyone.",5
1938,"Dear Andrew Ng,",5
1939,"Thank you, for giving this really nice experience almost for free, its good to know knowledge is being shared and not only capitalized by universities or industry. I found the explanations and material very well explained and excersices well designed (fun to do and interesting). By my count I looked for a some deep information about some topics, like for example demostration of SVM, and I gladly saw that there were some support material with this kind of content",5
1940,This course is great!,5
1941,This is the most comprehensive machine learning course I have ever come across. It has helped me to not only understand in-depth the concepts involved in machine learning but gave me practical application tips for implementation in real-life application. I have been able to connect the dots and figure out all the missing pieces which had been eluding me for quite a while since I dive into machine learning. Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and the entire course mentors.,5
1942,"A wonderful class! It's not very mathematical but indeed practical. The presentations are clear, and quizes and assignments are carefully designed. For the programming exercises I strugged a little bit on the dimensions of the matice and vectors, because the lectures and programs use some times different convention (e.g. X^(i) is usually a column vector in the video, but in the codes X^(i) is a row vector). But overall, it's a fantastic class. Thank you so much!",5
1943,"Having taken this course, I could confidently say that I have a great understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning. The course does a wonderful job of making complex concepts easier to follow. I also appreciate that the course comes with optional exercises for those who want to learn or review some of the deeper mathematics behind the machine learning models. Andrew Ng is an inspiring instructor and the mentors available are very responsive and helpful.",5
1944,"Awesome intro to machine learning! It gave me a great overview to some machine learning topics and inspired me to pursue several areas in greater depth. Professor Ng is a very clear instructor and I felt that he sufficiently explained all of the topics  that he covered. The programming exercises were very also very clear and thorough, and helped to cement the concepts in my mind. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started in ML.",5
1945,"Andrew did an excellent job of sharing his knowledge of machine learning.  The flow and organization of the course made it easier to keep up with and understand the material.  I especially appreciated the written week summaries present earlier in the course and hope more are added for the remaining weeks.  I also found the resources section of the course invaluable for completing the programming assignments.  Thank you Andrew, moderators, and Coursera community!",5
1946,+ Assignments +++,5
1947,This course is an excellent one for anyone who want to get into the world of Machine Learning.,5
1948,"Course was very well structured and full of practical implementations. However, back propagation algorithm needs more elaboration. Also, there should be some extra videos (non compulsory) for those who want to learn the matrix operations used in algorithms (e.g. covariance defined as X'E(-1)X or use of Eigenvalues in dimentionality reduction). Apart from this, it's the best online course I have taken and it truly deserves to be the largest online course offered.",5
1949,"I think this a great course of machine learning for all levels of knowledge. During this course you can learn how a machine learning algorithm works in a level of detail that allow an excellent understanding of the subject. The course also is very complete, touching a lot of interesting topics and focusing in machine learning actual practice. I am so glad I did take the course and I am sure it will suppose a great improvement in my work performance from now on. ",5
1950,"I've always been intimidated by the ""math"" but Prof Ng made it accessible without shying away completely. While I assume many underly principles are the same, it will be interesting to see what has changed since its publication. Python would have offered some hands-on time w the language I'll use most, so it's a bummer but not deal-breaker to use Octave. These are constructive remarks - I'm still so glad that this course was offered and that I chose it. Thanks!",5
1951,"I don't really know how to tell that, but this class was the best class I ever took, and I wished all of my previous teachers or instructors were so kindly reassuring, self-explicative and demonstrative.",5
1952,"This is a truly amazing course. Being a complete novice in the field of Machine Learning, this course was very welcoming and intriguing to capture my interest and has motivated me to start thinking on various applications where I can actually apply ML. Sincere thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng. He has taught the course exceptionally well. I am glad to have started my journey in ML with guidance from such a fantastic instructor. Thank You, Coursera! Thank You, Stanford!",5
1953,Superb course and glad I did this not only because it is free but because I wanted to learn about the core principles of Machine Learning so that I could understand libraries much better in programming languages (e.g Python). This has helped me get a solid understanding of Machine Learning - I will not be concentrating on using Python to apply it to my data. Octave was a great program but the visual cursor and interface was not the best on Mac OS unfortunately.,5
1954,Before taking this course I  had a little bit of exposure on machine learning but had no idea how machine learning algorithms work on the machine. I tried to use machine learning tools for building models but never satisfied with wanted to build models from scratch. All I can say the dream of building machine learning models from scratch  has been fulfilled . Andrew Ng sir was excellent I would say Indian professors should learn how to teach like Andrew Ng sir.,5
1955,"Excellent Course on Basics of Machine Learning taught in a simple way by Professor Andrew Ng. The examples provided were easily understood though it would be really advantageous to have prior knowledge of Linear Algebra, Statistics and Calculus but not mandatory. The Professor has made the explanations in such a way that they can be understood in a fairly simple manner but at the same time ensure that nothing is compromised from a quality or content perspective",5
1956,"I had heard about this course many a times perhaps all the time whenever I had searched for ""Best Machine Learning Course "". But now as I have experienced throughout the course, I am pretty confident to say that this course is indeed a best course for any ML beginner. Prof. Andrew Ng's intuitive teaching style along with appropriate amount of mathematics is the best thing about the course. Really many many thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for such a wonderful course.",5
1957,Excellent teaching!,5
1958,Very useful class even for someone with PhD in signal processing with over 20 years of work experience.  Professor NG has made some of the more complicated concepts very easy to understand. The computer assignments are designed perfectly to help you learn how to program rather complex ML algorithms without being cumbersome or impossible for a more beginner student.  Thank you Professor NG for preparing and providing such a fantastic learning experience for us.,5
1959,I have been privileged by great colleague to hear about this great class. I have been privileged by great family to understand I spend time taking this class. I have been privileged by great employer who understood I really wanted to learn this stuff and made it possible with giving time for this class. I have been privileged to be be part of this great global student community participating this class.,5
1960,"I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Ng's class.  I became busy with work and other activities during my time taking the course, and I was grateful to have an extension on my class schedule.  Professor Ng delivered advanced programming and mathematical theories in a very understandable manner while providing practical applications for the implementation of the aforementioned information.  I am looking forward to getting a chance to take on the Deep Learning courses.",5
1961,"One of the best courses to take. I personally learnt Neural Networks and many other topics were a timely revision for me.  The best part of the course was not just talking about Machine Learning concepts, Prof. Andrew has also spent time on the practical applications, debug principles and celing analysis on optimal efforts to invest for a successful system development. I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to become an expert in Machine Learning.  ",5
1962,"This course is very friendly to new learners of machine learning. The teacher is a famous scholar in this field, and his explanation is full and accurate. Besides, he will also give warnings about details occasionally, so that when you are actually working on a project, you will not wasting time doing useless thing. And the programming exercise is brilliant, not very hard, but requiring some time for new learners. I think I have benefit a lot from this course.",5
1963,"I really learned a lot! This course is well made, good instructions and much support when making the assignments. It provides a good introduction to machine learning. I'm just a beginner so I can't judge the level nor usefulness (i.e. can I start a career as data scientist based on this course). Though, prof. Ng claims I can consider myself en expert in ML now! :-) Nevertheless, I really learned a lot and also brushed up my matlab skills. Thank you very much!  ",5
1964,"An excellent course to expose you to different problem domains in ML space and the strategies for approaching them. The only qualm is that for the assignments, the heavy lifting seemed to be already done by the instructor and very minimal code was left for students to implement. Especially towards the later assignments, the assignments could have challenged us to break down the problem/components ourselves, with minimal guidance. Lots of learning nonetheless.",5
1965,"Let us appreciate the effort by honorable Prof. Dr. Andrew Ng for making this course online and also free. I learned so much thing about how Internet giant companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon making huge amount of money by deploying machine learning algorithms in their daily business and track people's privacy and security vulnerable in their data store by just predicting what can be next. Again thank you very much for giving knowledge about these stuffs.",5
1966,Thank you Dr. Andrew Ng for the wonderful course on ML and for Coursera. I really liked the way he taught and how the course moved forward. I like the fact that he covered debugging and time wasted on redundant activities which saves an ML engineer's time. ,5
1967,"Thank You Dr Andrew Ng for all these valuable knowledge of yours that you shared with us, I will never forget the day that I entered the world of AI by your excellent course. You've been a great teacher in my life not only for the knowledge you shared with us but also for being so calm and patient to teach all these complicated subjects, I didn't learn only AI in your course, I also learned how to behave professionally from you ... You changed my life Dr Ng !",5
1968,On summer 2019 I attended this Machine Learning course. ,5
1969,"Before this training session. I dont know anything about ML. But, after completion of this, I am very confident. Especially, I like the questions during session and exercises. I learnt majorly from exercises. Thanks for making this training session free of cost. Thanks to all those who have prepared exercises and quiz questions. Finally, A big thank to Andrew Ng, the way he is giving examples, explaining the things clearly. I really liked it. Thanks Coursera.",5
1970,"I really appreciate that the math in this course was understandable without having taken linear algebra or calculus (although I'm now inspired to take those classes!) Andrew made the material relevant and even humorous at times. His explanations and guidance through the material was excellent. I recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning, even (and especially) those who think they don't have the knowledge needed to understand the concepts.",5
1971,"Taught by one of the best minds in ML.  A must ML survey for those simply interested in becoming more conversant in the subject or even for those who eventually want to explore a career.  Coding exercises have a high learning curve for non-coders like myself but likely relatively straightforward for coding careerists.  Overall, helps to build a firm and practical foundation for most mainline learning models in use today for both shallow and deep applications.",5
1972,"This is one of the best courses I have taken in my life - MOOC or otherwise. I would like to thank Prof. ng, the mentors for this course (especially Tom Mosher - without whose tutorials and test cases I would not have completed the assignments) and also the fellow-students who took the time to post their observations on the message boards. My gratitude to Prof. Ng - his humility, his passion, and his generosity to share his knowledge have been an inspiration.",5
1973,"The teaching is easy to follow, and the assignment is well-designed. One would probably be able to build some machine learning algorithm to solve actual problems just after this one course, and that fact alone is remarkable. Regardless of one's occupation, it would be interesting to know a bit of machine learning, as in some cases, it indeed amazingly reflects how we humans actually acquire our knowledge. Thank you Prof. Ng for creating such a helpful course!",5
1974,"This is the best course one can find to begin learning Machine Learning. Almost every basic concept is covered in the course and the instructor has done a great job in organizing the course and the assignments. However, I personally feel that  ""DECISION TREES"" is the only frequently used technique in ML that is missing in this course. So, adding Decision trees Concept too would be very helpful and makes the course an equivalent master level course. Thank You.",5
1975,"This is a fantastic course! While the content is reasonably technical, it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience. The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow. I  have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to!",5
1976,"Taught by renowned Andrew Ng, you probably won't find any better course for developing a broad (but thorough) understanding of ML algorithm fundamentals.  ",5
1977,"The class is well organized and Prof Andrew covers many ML topics that are very practical and easily to learn, even for people without any ML experience. I'm pretty sure if we follow the class and finish all the assignments the students should have a very comprehensive view of what ML does and how it can solve the real problem. For more advanced technologies and mathematics proofs, this class does not explore much. However it cannot stop me liking this class! ",5
1978,Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and offered through Coursera is one of the best online course.  Course is fairly technical and does need a decent mathematical and computer background from the candidate.  But Dr. Ng has done an excellent work in presenting the complex materials in easy to understand language coupled with everyday examples.  Candidate just needs to have determination and some technical/mathematical background to successfully complete the course.,5
1979,"First of all I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for working up tirelessly and making all these video tutorials, quizzes and programming exercises. Secondly, all the materials provided are user friendly and helpful for future references. I am happy that I completed this course and learned a lot from you Sir.",5
1980,"An excellent introduction to machine learning excellent for people who have basic mathematical background (a  good high school level or first 2 years of a maths.physics degree) . My take is that this course is excellent for people who want to enter the field and need some general directions on the main topics to follow with more advanced studies (other courses. books, online resoureces).",5
1981,"The course was well designed right from basics, algorithms, theoretical aspects, analysis and decision making. There are some hiccups one is regularization quiz has little advanced aspects and in one of the programming assignment has vague about use of lambda for testing set. Except them everything is full of joy in learning. The course kept on increasing the confidence to build Machine Learning systems to problems at work. Thank you Andrew Sir and the team.",5
1982,"I really enjoyed taking this course. It is definitely worth the effort. It provides a lot of insight into many key concepts in machine learning. From my point of view, what I liked the most is that even being an introductory course, it has a very nice balance between theoretical depth and motivation, between the focus on the mathematical foundations and practical applications of the algorithms discussed. The programming exercises are just amazing. Thank you!",5
1983,"Thank you Coursera and Sir Andrew Ng for giving me this opportunity to learn Machine Learning from this platform. Undoubtedly, Coursera is the best online learning (E-Learning) platform.  This course helped me to learn all the basics very clearly and allowed me to set my career in Machine Learning. Once again, thanks a lot Coursera and Sir Andrew Ng. I hope I would get more opportunities to build my career in Machine Learning. This course is the best course.",5
1984,"Very useful and practical course. A lot of fundamental theories also included. However, training is mostly just designed to complete a part or some pieces of a whole system, so learners may not understand how to design/implement a deep learning system from scratch. In my opinion, if there is some exercises cover this issue, the course would be more useful. But anyway, such a valuable and easy to understand course, even on difficult theories of Deep Learning!",5
1985,我是做毕业设计时接触的这门课，它为我提供了很多处理数据的思路。工科生难免需要和各种模型算法打交道，这门课涉及到的很多算法可以在数据挖掘、模式识别中得到应用，让我对很多之前一看到就头疼的算法有了较直观的概念。老师不是从冷冰冰的公式推导和严谨的数学证明来介绍一个新方法，而是从实际的角度出发，有应用场景地、符合思维模式地递进，因此可以更好的了解一个算法是在做什么，以及为什么在该应用背景下选择了这种方法。在面对自己专业中遇到的实际问题时，能够更直观的进行类比，确定自己要使用哪种方法。老师课上的讲述清晰有条理，但除开这些不说，我特别喜欢老师讲课的感觉以及对课程的把握，有几次我刚对前一句话产生疑问，老师的后一句话就做出了解答，这让我很兴奋。另外，老师本人在相关领域很有造诣，但在课程中给我的感受不像是老师给学生上课，更像是在给大家介绍自己喜爱的事物或人一样。课程中的问题、测验和编程作业都经过精心的设计，真的特别明显的感觉到老师的严谨和用心。我特别喜欢这种上课的感觉，也真诚的感谢老师和平台，可以让更多的学生接触到高质量的课程。,5
1986,"We will get an overall introduction of where ML is being used at the present times. Also we will get to know how to implement different types of regressions on basic use cases. Knowing a bit of LinearAlgebra and Differentiation techniques is a plus. Assignments are very properly planned, in such a way that with the simple hints and descriptions which are given, one can easily solve the problems. Professor Ng also explains the content in very simpler fashion.",5
1987,"This is a landmark course for people willing to start their journey in the fascinating field of Machine Learning- Prof Andrew Ng takes you on this amazing journey, assuming just the basic knowledge, and explain everything comprehensively in a lucid manner- be it the ideas, intuition behind the mathematics, or the practical considerations involved. I can not thank, Prof Andrew and the entire team which made this online course possible, enough for this course.",5
1988,"Greatly exceeded expectations, finished with a far better understanding of machine learning, its application and the basic skills to be able to pursue my own projects. Quality of the instruction was superb. I especially liked the focus on the ""intuition"" to get a ""feel"" for the concepts prior to the math, and particularly the programming assignments which really helped cement the concepts and allow one to develop the practical skills and tools to apply them.",5
1989,,5
1990,"This is a first time for me to learn Machine Learning by myself through this e-learning system. I have an impression that this course has been made been has been made very well curriculum combining video, short question and programming exercises. Especially, the exercises has been made very well, and I could understand machine learning technology clearly and precisely. I would like to recommend this class to my friend who are interested in Machine learning.",5
1991,"I wouldn't know how to say thank you to Pr. Andrew Ng for this amazing course and his great way of teaching. This course is created when I only had 11 years old, I will have my 20 years old this week, and people still learn a lot from it from all over the world (I'm a CS student in Algeria). This is really great and inspiring. Thank you so much Sir ! and thanks to the community and the people who helped improving this course and online learning in general !",5
1992,"This ML course helps you understand Machine Learning starting from the very basics to advanced topics. Andrew does a great job at explaining each topic in layman terms that makes it very easy to understand. The course is well planned in the way it increases complexity over the weeks and takes you through exciting applications along the way. All in all, a very engaging course and recommend it for anybody who wants to start out on ML or use it as a refresher.",5
1993,It was the best course I have attended in my life.It was worth every second and I have learned a lot of things especially in programming that I'm sure I'll find invaluable.I would also like to thank professor Ng for being a passionate and amazing teacher as I was able to understand complex topics in a simple way that I would not have been able to grasp easily in such a short period of time being an absolute newcomer to this field.Thanks a million professor!,5
1994,"Thank you Andrew Ng for this very informative and useful course. This was a great introduction to Machine Learning and did not require prerequisite knowledge. I very much enjoyed that you not only taught us ""what to do"" but also ""how to do it well"". This is an ingredient I find is often missing in online courses, and I am very grateful for the expert advice you gave in this direction. The quizzes and programming exercises were enjoyable to work through too.",5
1995,"Excellent presentation, course material, and presenter. The course has balanced material for Algebra, formulas, questions, and hands-on programming exercises. Walking in I thought I had some machine learning knowledge, and after completed this course, I realized that a good part of my knowledge was still shallow and not correctly structured. I feel more confident reading now and digging deeper into Machine Learning problems.  I highly recommend this course. ",5
1996,"This course is fantastic. I like Andrew's teaching so much. Through this class, I have learned a lot about machine learning. I feel I might not be so familiar with some of the learning algorithms. I would like to go through this course once again and  tamping my understanding about machine learning, especially the advice on building a machine learning system. Thank you Andrew and your team to give me such a wonderful learning venture. Wish you all the best.",5
1997,"Such a good intro to machine learning! It was really clearly organized and explained from the very fundamentals. It was easy even for me, with only medical education behind myself. I was already familiar with matlab, so at least I didn't have much to catch up on regarding the script language. However, I would have liked to have more programming assignments, or maybe some more optional assignments that we have to build from zero. Anyway, I liked it a lot! :)",5
1998,"Andrew has been one of the best professors I've ever had, clear, interesting, engaging and always challenging. The course was very interesting to me, but mostly with a complete view of the different tipologies of machine learning algorithms and applications, and with the right speed. I appreciated a lot the programming exercises, very important to fix what I learnt. ",5
1999,,5
2000,"  I have taken a course on machine learning before, but this course covered many facets of machine learning that that course did not. ",5
2001,Pros: Really awesome course. Learned a lot from assignments . Andrew sir explained the difficult topics with so ease. Discussion forums helped a lot which i got stuck on particular assignment. The topics are structured well enough to guide step by step learning.,5
2002,"This is the best introductory course on machine learning there is, Andrew Ng makes it a breeze to walk through very complicated algorithms for which the math could seem nightmarish. The examples chosen to illustrates the concepts of this course come from real-world problem and the programming assignment are well guided. I was advised to enter the ML world by starting with this course and I would thoroughly give the same advice to anyone with the same goal.",5
2003,"There are so many information and so much intuition given in this class that if I tried to learn them all, all by myself it would take months of research and really hard work even with guidance. Andrew is a great teacher, well prepared and very intuitive. Everybody can try to teach, but not everybody can be a teacher even if they are making a living out of teaching. Andrew is one of those rare people who is really good at teaching. Thank you for the class!",5
2004,"Great overview of Machine Learning for the uninitiated.  Doesn't assume knowledge of higher mathematics (Statistics, Calculus, Linear Algebra) but having a background in math and programming makes this course easier.  By spending 6-8 hours a day working on this course, I was able to complete it in two weeks without serious problems.  On occasion the programming exercises were a little vague but the resources tab is a lot of help if you get stuck debugging.",5
2005,The course is well structured and planned. I found Andrew's lectures easy to follow. The material is hard and I found myself viewing lectures more than once not because they were not explained well but because it took me a few tries to grasp some concepts. I'm glad I stuck through and finished it. I'll probably need to go back and re-read some lectures and try some assignments one more time. But it was well worth the effort. Thanks Andrew. Thanks Coursera.,5
2006,"Fantastic course. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. This course taught me the necessary foundations to tackle more complicated problems. The programming exercises are moderately difficult, but is a great way to allow us to learn how to transform mathematical equations into vectorized coding. Overall, I highly recommend this course to students without prior machine learning knowledge. I will be re-reviewing the course materials to solidify these core concepts!",5
2007,"As i always heard from millions of people this is best course on Machine Learning i prefer you take a course in Udemy then get back here coz the content here is more of mathematical way of understanding i'm not that much happy with Nueral Networks as i couldn't understand 50% of it. But still this course has taught me and cleared many many mnay things in Machine Learning. Best Teacher on Machine Learning. It took 20 days to complete for me , Go for it. ;)",5
2008,"About ten years ago I have been taught of machine learning in the computer science course I was attending at the university. Revisiting these concepts today in this ML course was not just a refresher for my mind, but I appreciated the flow, level of detail and how well intertwined are the theory, quizzes and programming assignments.",5
2009,This one of the best course available with all support one needs in ML and can help anyone  grow deep into DATA SCIENCE and AI fields. Very experienced and knowledgeable lectures and more than that Mr Andrew Ng is awesome in every  related way to the matter.,5
2010,This has been a fantastic introduction to Machine Learning by Professor Ng. I really appreciated the depth and coverage of the course instruction. Professor Ng does an amazing job of conveying the intuition behind each of the machine learning algorithms and their applications. The programming exercises were also very well thought through and really enhanced the learning and understanding. Thank you very much Professor Ng. for making this course available.,5
2011,Professor Ng does a great job at explaining low-level implementations of popular supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.  He also teaches about diagnostics that can be used to determine where an engineer's time is best spent to improve an algorithm.  The hands-on programming exercises force you to really understand what is going on behind the scenes of these powerful algorithms.  A must take class if you are studying machine learning on your own.,5
2012,"This course is very easy to understand even if you have no mathematical background.
",5
2013,"This course needs no review. It's a classic on its own. I love the way Prof. Ng explains complex things. The review questions and assignments all are designed perfectly so that the concepts become clearer. I have taken many courses on Machine Learning on other places, but either they are too much focused on programming, or too much focused on the theory. This course has the perfect balance of everything you need to know to become an expert in this field.",5
2014,This was the best online class I have ever taken. I have learned so much from it and can without a doubt say that I am much more familiar with Machine Learning. Coming in to the class I wanted to get a grasp of some of the concepts I had heard of like Neural Networks and Supervised Learning. Through the lectures and the Programming assignments I found more information and gradually became more confident in the material. ,5
2015,"Very worthwhile as a first introduction into machine learning! This course aims at a very diverse audience, and therefore the technical and (even more so) the mathematical content is kept at a very simple level. This is great to help viewers overcome hurdles, but may feel a bit slow for people with a mathematical or IT background. However, the clarity with which Prof. Ng presents ML topics more than compensates for the occasional slow patch. Thank you!!!",5
2016,"It's a very good training. I had mainly intuitions about how Machine Learning was working, and I wanted to understand what's under the hood. The training gives all the foundation to runderstand the main use cases of the current business trends. It gives the theorical aspects but the hands-on sessions for each weeks allow to put in practices what is learned. Thanks Andrew, I'm more confident to better understand the discussions with my peers and partners.",5
2017,"The course provides an excellent overview of machine learning and its concepts and provides a strong foundation for further learning in the topic (or related topics such as deep learning). The course and its material are laid out clearly. Instructor Andrew Ng does a suburb job at explaining the various machine learning concepts, that includes a brief discussion on the mathematical background and theory for each of the various machine learning algorithms.",5
2018,"Hands down, best introductory course to Machine Learning. It starts off as a very easy course and you will feel that you will be able to complete this 11 week course in just a couple of weeks. But then we dive into the intricacies of ML and you start respecting ML and its concepts.The best part of this course is you start off as a total beginner and by the end of this course, you will be, in the own words of Andrew N G - ""an expert in Machine learning"" !",5
2019,It is a good course if you want to get into the mathematics behind the algorithms that one blindly uses while trying out machine learning projects. It is also a best way to start learning about ML if you have never dived into this domain before. What is the most appealing about this course is that doesn't need you to have any extraordinary pre-requisites. Knowing a bit of calculus and limits might add on to your experience but it is really not mandatory.,5
2020,"People who are looking to learn the basics and start talking machine learning language , then this is the right course for you. Also as a side note , if you are coming from maths background , it will be worthwhile to spend some time on derivations. (of-course for your own satisfaction). Lastly I understand a significant effort must have gone in preparing this material. Sincerely thank you for all this. I shall be taking your next series of deep learning.",5
2021,"For an engineer, it's an easy course.. Math is simple... Avoidance from advanced stuff in Linear algebra, estimation theory or statistics, HOWEVER, this is what makes it a good course! It makes the material very accessible to people with different backgrounds, has lot's of PRACTICAL tips that I think should be beneficial, and has great examples and exercises. I think Andrew is a very good lecturer and has a very good approach for teaching.",5
2022,,5
2023,"On of the most exciting fields today - Machine Learning - has been taught so very comprehensively by Professor Ang , that this course becomes almost mandatory to complete in order to gain insight and get the basics of this field. The BEST course ever. Professor Ang had my attention to the very last lecture and this emphasizes on how brilliantly this course has been designed and taught by him. Kudos to the mentors who guided everyone through this process.",5
2024,,5
2025,The class was very interesting and challenging and I learn a lot! I would recommend it if you wish to get a good feel for what machine learning is. I was very satisfied to learn about the possible applications and liked the guidance throughout the lectures on how to efficiently build machine learning systems. I hope I could apply it one day in the field on biophysics I'm currently working on. ,5
2026,"Excellent course for everyone who wants to start to learn ML from the basics. Andrew is a great teacher. It's not a course with focus on Math, but on algorithms and applications; however, IMHO, the main concepts are clearly explained, giving to the student a good comprehension of the main topics of Machine Learning. Perhaps, the only negative issue is that the course uses Octave/Matlab instead of Python, but, anyways, I defenitely recommend this course.",5
2027,Very interesting and well built course and I highly recommend it to anyone who want to understand the various ML technique and how to use them in practice. I would have preferred the assignment to be in Pyhton (rather than Octave/Matlab) though. Also it would have been good at the end to position the course versus modern ML framework as in practice not many people will code from scratch such algorithm. Or at least provide link to such kind of resources. ,5
2028,"This is the best! I'm a neuroscience/psychology researcher (graduate student) and the machine learning was new to me. However, Andrew's lectures were always clear, and I finally finished this course and then little by little, learned how to apply the machine learning to our field of studies.",5
2029,"very well-structured course for machine learning enthusiasts, in a way even beginners can easily adapt.  clear lecture videos with in-depth explanations of concepts and algorithms.  I really enjoyed doing the programming exercises because they gave the opportunity to practically test out those equations in real-world scenarios.  Overall it was a comprehensive learning experience and I'm glad I chose this course to delve into the machine learning domain.",5
2030,"I heard a lot about machine learning. I used ready-made libraries and applied machine learning. But I could not understand why this or that parameter is used. On the other hand, when I was a student, we studied several math courses. But we were not told where all these formulas can be applied. Thanks to this course, I not only began to understand the essence of machine learning, but also where to apply my theoretical knowledge of mathematics. Thank you.",5
2031,"Thank you Andrew Ng for making this course available for free to all of us that are interested in machine learning topics. Thanks to you I have a very good base on machine learning, and I am more clear on what to do next in this area. I hope to take your deep learning courses because I really like how detailed you explain all of the concepts of the class and I want to continue learning more about it. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Best regards, Musa",5
2032,"Very very amazing course. It took me back to my school/high-educational ages where a lot of mathematic was learned. By the time we forget a lot, but this course is a good opportunity to all engineers-in-past to return to their roots and apply their knowledges to something new and heavy. Andrew Ng is a great person, humble and very clever, i wish everybody be surrounded by similar persons. Don't hesitate on whether taking this course or not. Start now ;) ",5
2033,A wonderful course on Machine Learning that gives a very good understanding of the underlying fundamental concepts and approaches. The coverage of the topics and the approach taken by Andrew Ng in delivering the content is very good. Programming exercises with Octave helped us to try out the concepts learnt and to see them in action. A very highly recommended course for those who want to improve their understanding and skills on Machine Learning domain.,5
2034,I'm a programmer with 10 year of experience.,5
2035,"Very clear explanations of the important concepts. Very clear but not simple. It is better to design the  programming exercises in Python or R because in practice people will encounter these more often. The reason for using Matlab, I guess, is that Matlab is good at vectorized programming, which is essential in implementing the algorithms. But Python and R would be equally, if not more, competitive in doing this. Generally, the course is worth the time.",5
2036,"Its really greate to know about the key concepts, algorithms and methods used for machine learning. I really like the way each and every concepts explained in the course with greate enthusiasm. Andrew has always made key highlights in each video which really help a lot while developing any system using corresponding algorithm. In short it was a greate experience and would really contribute a lot in the long run for better prospects. Thanks a lot .....:)",5
2037,"It is my very first Machine Learning course and one of the best courses I have taken. Andrew can explain the concepts and ideas in an super explicit way. These terms and algorithm used to seem convoluted and intimidating to me. With just a little bit knowledge of linear algebra, I actually finished all the homework. I have gained a lot of hands-on experience from doing these assignment which are all closely related to our daily lives. Thank you, Andrew!  ",5
2038,Thank you so much Professor Andrew Ng for such a wonderful course !     It changed my perspective that the Machine Learning is not just about using fancy algorithms but to understand the working behind basic algorithms and more specifically to analyse and improve their efficiency.     The programming assignments were exhaustive and rather frustrating sometimes but I really enjoyed them and also the Octave is a great tool which I had never heard before.,5
2039,"I have a Master's Degree in Digital Image Computing and as part of our coursework we learned many techniques which included machine learning, But i vaguely had an idea how to use those techniques. After attending this course i was able understand machine learning more thoroughly and I'm confident on using it in real life problems. I thank everyone who worked behind this course and made my life a lot easier. Thank you Andrew Ng for this awesome lecture.",5
2040,"This course is excellent.  For anyone looking to start quickly but not skip on the foundation that will help you work through inevitable problems that will happen when you switch to your own applications, this is really hard to beat.  Hats off to Andrew and Stanford for making this as accessible as they have.  The compounding value of having high grade AI/machine learning literacy learning resources broadly and affordably available can't be overstated.",5
2041,"Excellent course! Andrew Ng's teaching is great. He covers the main topics in machine learning, with appropriate math and good amount of time on the big picture. The programming exercises are mostly about the real applications of machine learning and are good compliment to the theories taught. The exercises are well explained, and the frameworks are already well set so only the core algorithm part is required to complete, which is very kindly designed. ",5
2042,"Excellent course. A great introduction to all aspects of ML. The exercises, quizzes and assignments were very intense and really made us think before answering. They helped in strengthening the concepts learnt in the videos. In addition to ML techniques, I also learnt Matlab/Octave along the way. Thank you for putting this great material.",5
2043,"This is by far the best course for people to get knowledge of machine learning in practice, especially for people who are working full day and are not actual students.",5
2044,"A fantastic and very well-organized course. I have no background in Machine Learning, and felt that I learned a great deal from the course.

2046,"Best online course I have ever had. Andrew feels like very humble person and someone who knows how to teach. I have learned very much using this course and would like to thank him for organizing this course in such an interactive manner by giving amazing exercises. I would also like to thank Coursera Org. for accepting my financial aid application and letting me attend his course, after completing this now I can apply for jobs I would like. Thank you. ",5
2047,"Great course. Very well designed learning curve, ease into the things that student don't know or aware of. Never assumed student know anything too complicated, resulting easy to understand concepts. Distilled contents that's relevant in a concise way. Focusing on the idea, not the nitty gritty details of the programming language used make this course a little bit programming language 'generic'. Overall great course to start on Machine Learning course!",5
2048,"Excellent course.  Presentation by Andrew Ng is very, very good. He is really an excellent teacher. The material was, literally, amazing. Particularly the neural networks and SVMs.  The gradual introduction of complexity is very well thought out. Practical guidance for successful implementation is very valuable. Lastly the supporting material is great, including lesson slides, lecture notes, and particularly the text and code supporting the exercises.",5
2049,Thanks to Andrew for creating such wonderful course which has been the benchmark for every individual starting up with ML ... This course is the best course you can find till date to start with ML. I loved every bit of it and it makes be feel happy to have completed the course.

He has knack for simplifying complex ideas and highlighting what's important. The programming assignments were challenging and the quizzes made sure you understood the nuances and details of key points. Overall, I really like the Coursera online teaching platform. ",5
2057,A great course to learn the essence of various Machine Learning tools. The course helps you to understand math behind the Algorithms so that you don't need to rely on ready-made libraries to implement most of them. Octave/MATLAB is actually a good tool to implement Machine Learning algorithms. A good thing about this course is that Prof. Ng takes a good amount of time to give practical advice with help of Learning Curves or other algorithm analysis.,5
2058,"What a fantastic course! Thank you Andrew Ng, and for all of the tutors/moderators in this course. The comprehensive knowledge I obtained about machine learning will no doubt take me a long ways in my career as a data scientist. Andrew's course material was very well thought out, balanced, and organized and he provided a lot of very good insight from years worth of experience that will enable me to become a better data science engineer. Thank you!!!",5

I found his lectures very easy to understand and also fun to watch. Thank you for making this course for us and making a hard to understand the subject so easy. Truly appreciate the effort behind the course. Thank you once again.",5
2060,"Great course, the amount of information that Andrew managed to explain in a few weeks course is astonishing. The capacity of teaching algorithms that many times involves more complex mathematical knowledge than most of the people usually know and yet in a simple manner is one of the strong points of this course. If you are looking to have a good understanding of the foundations that are behind many machine learning projects this is the right course.",5
2061,"This had been an amazing learning experience for me. Prof. Andrew,s way of delivering information and interaction worked like the icing on the cake. Thank you so much for sharing knowledge on Machine Learning with getting most of my basics clear. The programming exercises worked very well as practical lessons, on completion of which, I could feel confident on each topic. Overall, this proved to be the best learning course on Machine Learning so far.",5
2062,"One of the most rewarding aspects of this course was the opportunity to code. Prior to this course, my background in coding was very limited to a few assignments I did 20 years ago for an undergraduate class. Professor Ng is a superb teacher, and the course is very student friendly, which by no means is to be misconstrued as easy. The course was quite challenging and time-consuming, but totally worth every minute I spent. Great thanks, Professor Ng!",5
2063,"Extraordinary!! First took this class in early 2017--3+ years ago. I followed that with Hinton's online class at the University of Toronto, audited cs2229 and cs231 until I felt that my programming skills needed to improve for me to gain much more in the machine learning area. 2019 and 2020 were spent almost entirely on programming; mostly Python and Unix. Now, I have come full circle and anxious to go back the the Stanford online ML courses again!",5
2064,"This is the best beginner-level course on Machine Learning. Andrew has done a commendable job in structuring this course to suit anyone who is trying to take a leap in the field of ML. His teaching is exemplary and the course assignments are just mind-blowing.  The programming exercises were fun to solve with equal emphasis on the project idea, theoretical concepts, and optimization through vectorizations. To conclude this was a fun course to take.",5
2065,"It was a great opportunity for me to learn an advanced topic i.e. Machine learning from a top university's instructor. This course not only increased my skill set, it also actively contributed in my research investigations. Hence, I greatly appreciate all the efforts that were put in order to make this course available online. I want to thank everyone involved in the creation of this course which proved to be a wonderful learning experience for me.",5

2067,"Due to the special time, the coronavirus-19, I have lots of time spent at home, Machine Learning is the first course I took on Coursera, and it makes me gain the basic knowledge about the Machine Learning. It is a wonderful course because it combines some programming practice of matlab, which not only gives an intuitive sense for the content but also improve my programming skill. I highly recommend this course if you are interested in data science.",5
2068,T,5
2069,"I'd already gone through the videos of CS 229 before taking on this course. Although CS 229 was very theoretical and mathematically oriented, this course has helped me learn the intuition behind various concepts of Machine Learning. Learning to write complex vectorized code will definitely help me in any sort of numerical programming that I take. The programming assignments were succinct and review questions thought-provoking. Thank you, Andrew Ng!",5
2070,"This is one of the best machine learning course out there giving in depth knowledge about different techniques. For me this course came as a source of great knowledge and fun. While working through the course it is quite intimidating because you have to sit, listen, think but you will get a state euphoria for understanding it clearly. Thank you so much Andrew Ng for this course now I can consider Machine Learning as a field to advance my career in.",5
2071,"Excellent. It explains all the great thing in a very concise manner. On the other hand, Machine Learning keeps growing and evolving (being the hype of the decade), and since this course was created some seven years ago, I cannot help but wonder how much of it is no longer up to date. Maybe there should be a ""Machine learning 2"" course, although I believe that would be Professor Ng's Deep learning specialization, which I am going to take right away.",5
2072,I strongly believe that this course help me get started with ML with a great knowledge sense.,5
2073,"A great course to familiarize yourself with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Prof. Ng's clear explanations made it accessible even for those who, like me, don't come from a computer science, math or tech background. It took me probably much longer than it took other people to finish the programming exercises, but the forums and tutorial came in to help! Thanks to the classmates and Mentors for posting and replying to all the questions.",5
2074,"Great introduction to understand how machine learning applications work. I really appreciate the effort to give an insight about what is relevant and what not, where to put the effort, how to improve an implementation, how real applications are designed. It is not just a description of tools and algorithms, it really helps understand what we can expect from machine learning technology today. It is also great to  jump-start working on this AI field. ",5
2075,"There was quite a bit of math compared with Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning as well some issues to work around different terminology etc. but overall I  think I learned quite a bit from this course particularly regarding foundations. It may not cover quite as many algorithms and is possibly getting a bit dated however I appreciated the discussions on evaluating algorithms and the discussions on applications for online, map reduce and pipelines.",5
2076,,5
2077,"Realmente um curso completo, sempre fui fascinado pela área e agora pude, do Brasil, realizar esse curso fantástico. Mesmo que você seja como eu, que não tenha condições de pagar o curso, o faça de modo gratuito, afinal, o que vale em si não é o papel, mas o que você vai fazer para si e para o mundo com o conhecimento adquirido. Obrigado, professor Andrew, espero que possamos nos encontrar e conversar pessoalmente em algum momento de nossas vidas.",5
2078,"This is a great introductory course into modern machine learning concepts including linear & logistic regressions, neural networks and detection algorithms.

Andrew is a very talented professor and I was glad to take his lessons, even in this virtual aspect. His examples and short out of scope comments indicate he is a great person.",5
2080,"Fantastic course, well taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. It is an intensive introduction to all the essentials in ML plus more. The quizzes and programming exercises can be tough at times, but very educational and fun if you invest the time and effort to get to know the subject. I got a kick time and again getting the algorithms to work - converting the mathematics behind it to working code. I highly recommend this to anyone with interest in the subject. ",5
2081,Great course on ML that teaches the theoretical and analytical aspects along with many inspiring real world examples and lots of advise. One interesting thing is that this course doesn't touch coding explicitly there are plenty of programming exercises but instructor doesn't spoon feed the implementation to the students that actually is a good thing. Students can learn to implement the algorithms on their own after understanding the core concepts.    ,5
2082,"El curso ha sido de gran ayuda para avanzar como profesional del sector. Las clases están estructuradas de forma que es sencillo seguir al profesor. Además de enseñar temas básicos de la materia te introduce a conceptos avanzados y mecanismos de optimización que son de gran ayuda. Si quieres empezar, o profundizar en este tema, es un curso muy recomendable. Muchas gracias a Andrew Ng y a todo el grupo de mentores por el gran trabajo que han hecho.",5
2083,"Prof. Andrew Ng is excellent. The course is engaging. Assignments are challenging but doable. Mentor Tom Mosher answers questions quickly and helpfully. My only complaint is that the instructions for the Neural Network Training assignment we are given one set of instructions, but then when inquiring for assistance in the forum we are directed to read a different set of instructions. The instructions in the matlab code and/or pdf should be updated.",5
2084,"This is a great primer on Machine Learning. Professor Ng goes through enough of the theory and gets straight to practical scenarios and applications of the theories taught each week. The programming assignments really hinge on your ability to understand Matrix Multiplication for the many vectorized implementations of algorithms covered in class. Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng, I learned how industry experts do the cool things they do with big data.",5
2085,"The course is very informative. I've enjoyed listing to NG explanations - there were many examples throughout the course, so it was easy to see how the algorithms are used in today's industry.",5
2086,Awesome course. Its even better if you make an effort to familiarize yourself with the mathematics behind the algorithms mentioned in the course. The MATLAB assignments are very useful in exhibiting the practical applications of the Machine Learning Algorithms taught.,5
2087,"Wonderful explanations and examples, I really liked the intuition and geometrical meaning explained, it made the whole topic so much more comprehensible. ",5
2088,"The best I ever took and a very huge step in achieving my career goals. Thanks to Coursera, thanks to Stanford University, and a very deep and huge thanks to Andrew Ng, I may not have met you, but I hope a time will I come I get to really appreciate you as much as I wish. You just transformed a life Andrew. I hope to apply this superlatively in almost every practicable way and make life better . All the best in your life endeavours. I appreciate.",5
2089,This was just an amazing Machine Learning Course from a beginners to an intermediate level.

Prof. Andrew is just amazing when he explains the maths behind an algorithm. The programming assignment were well organised. I learnt a lot from this course and I am satisfied with the motive of the course.,5
2090,"Well taught in a simple, non-pretentious way.  Good programming assignments where we were tasked with building our own working Machine Learning scripts which we should be able to adapt to solve other problems! I've come out of this course understanding a lot more about the buzz words ""machine learning"", ""big data"", etc as well as the opportunities and limitations of using machine learning. ",5
2091,Really liked the details that Prof Andrew Ng has provided about the applications of various tools and when to apply what. There are many courses available online but very few provide the insights of ML like this course do. Many Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng!,5
2092,"Great course for learning the fundamentals, and for providing a broad overview of the main topics in Machine Learning. The course has 8 assignments which touch briefly on how to actually implement the algorithms. The course serves its purpose and segues well into higher-level, and application-focused courses. MATLAB was very easy to use (especially if you already familiar with the syntax) and it shouldn't be too difficult to transition to Python.",5
2093,One of the best machine learning courses you can find on the internet. The difficulty and the course layout is set in such a way that even a beginner understands it really well. The assignments are really illustrative which gives us a proper insight on how to implement different various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. I'd really like to recommend this course to everyone who gets fascinated by the idea of machine learning.,5
2094,I strongly recomment this course for everyone who wants to gain basic knowledge about machine learning algorythms used on some basic problems. I had a great time while programming assingments for this class. Watching how great and powerfull can these algorythms be when used properly was awesome feeling. I have learned so much and i am looking forward to pass more classes like this particular one. Thank you for oportunity to be part of this class.,5
2095,"Overall a wonderful course. The course structure as well as the homework structure and the choice of what to focus about in the programing assignments allows quick learning of the major concepts, without investing too much time in learning to program in matlab. I recommend to take the course at the same time a friend/colleague takes it so you can discuss the learned concepts (and get advice if needed), which improves your memory and unerstanding.",5
2096,Andrew is a wonderful presenter who is warm and friendly. He teaches a fairly complex subject at a level that most STEM graduates would be comfortable with. The material is highly relevant and the steps taken to reinforce the learning of the material (quizzes and programming assignments) has been well chosen. I am deeply appreciative of the time and effort that has gone in to making this course available. Thank you Andrew and Stanford University.,5
2097,"This class is pretty much incredible, not much else to say about it. The instructor clearly has a deep theoretical understanding of the field, but explains everything in a totally intuitive and concise manner that makes it easier to wrap your head around the math. There's no reason to not take this course if you're anywhere in the vicinity of data science -- even if you're already an expert, the pedagogy will help you explain it to everyone else. ",5
2098,"teaches the concepts of Machine Learning in a nice, simplified manner. No advanced mathematics skills needed for learning the concepts, though it is good to have to appreciate some of the end results. Got me back to programming on matlab/octave after a long time, I enjoyed this part! The quizzes are nicely constructed to test the learning at right level. Hoping to apply the learning in my work to improve productivity. Overall, my time well spent! ",5
2099,"This is a great introduction to machine learning algorithm. Eight machine learning algorithms are covered during this 11-week course, including special use cases, advice for building machine learning system, and of course quizzes and exercises assignment. In order to follow this course, you will need, at a minimum, a basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus. Thanks to Professor Andrew Ng for making a quiet complex subject a real breeze.",5
2100,"I found this course VERY helpful. The way Andrew teaches the machine learning concepts is unparalleled! The course is well structured, well-timed, and well presented. I also appreciate the practical  experience that I came away with by doing the Octave exercises. Because I was engaged, I think I have retained at least 90% of what was taught. Thank you Andrew and the forum moderators. Thank you to other students for sharing their insights as well. ",5
2101,"This was a fantastic course. I worried that it would be over my head, particularly since I have not taken a math class since I was in college nearly 40 years ago. The class provided an overview of the math I needed and then consistently presented algorithms and challenging concepts in an accessible fashion. I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to get started doing something practical with machine learning and artificial intelligence.",5
2102,I enjoyed doing this course. Professor Ng clearly explained the topics and made me understand more about the inner workings of the different machine learning algorithms. It was also enjoyable refereshing my past math knowledge about lineair algebra and differentiation. Also the mentors was a great help for extra clarifying some questions I had. This course made me enthiusiastic to to learn more about datascience. I fully recommended this course! ,5
2103,"a lot of fundamental understanding on machine learning algorithms. and Andrew also provide an overview from a higher level. It is indeed a great course. If there is something to improve, I would say that the notes do not summarize the key points in a concise and clear way. A lot of important information is expressed verbally with some difficulty to capture into bullet points. This makes it harder to summarize the key knowledge after the lecture. ",5
2104,"This is definitely the greatest online course in machine learning! It is friendly to new learners and easy to get started for students with or without computers background. Through learning this course, I am more confident about my future work and have more interests in utilizing ML in my field. After learning with Prof. Ng for a month, the ending video impressed and touched me deeply. Thank you very much for bringing us a superexcellent course!",5
2105,"Great course!  I agree with Professor Ng's reasoning for teaching the class using Matlab.  I always prefer to understand what is going on ""under the hood"" with any library I might use in the future, and that is what this course provides.  ",5
2106,"Excellent! A comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning. Absolutely amazing instructor.  From his lectures, it is pretty clear that he absolutely loves the subject and imparting knowledge. He put in a lot of effort to make the learning experience amazing. Not only did he introduce new concepts/material but also he also talks about best practices and discusses examples from industry. Hats off, Prof Andrew Ng and the Teaching staff. Thank you!",5
2107,"It's just not the content of the course which was remarkably designed, its also about how it has been delivered. One of the very few programs that inspire you to get along and keep you always fresh and curious. The course certainly is going to help me in my current professional responsibilities and it has opened avenues for me to think much further than what we can do currently with Machine Learning. Thanks a lot for such a wonderful experience!",5
2108,I really believe that I know something about Machine Learning now. Having my own IT company I will start looking for opportunities to put the learnt into effect.,5
2109,"The best introduction into Machine Learning. Andrew Ng is able to guide students from introductory, simple topics all the way to complex, real-life Machine Learning techniques with the aid of very good examples and homework projects.

Definitely recommending this course to anyone who wants to enter this hot branch of Data Science.",5
2110,Thank you so much professor Andrew Ng. I learned a lot by following your course.,5
2111,"The course is very good on building up concepts. It will be good to have a background knowledge of hypothesis testing and data preparation, to understand where all this will fit in, but is not a perquisite.",5
2112,"Dr. Ng does a great job transfering his knowledge and experience on the subject to the on-line students, describing in detail every equation and every subscript. ",5
2113,Great introductory course. Should be learnt in conjunction with another textbook. Prof. Andrew Ng covers a lot of concepts. Some videos though may seem like repetition should be viewed again to understand the concepts advocated by him. I have found it very useful to attend live ML/AI lectures/meetups and then talk to people about this course and discuss some specific topics. It is amazing how much Prof Ng has covered in the videos and exercises.,5
2114,"Thank you so much for this!! This course is an amazing introduction, which can be recommended to everyone that wants to learn about Machine Learning but doesn't know where to start. Andrew Ng makes sure that at all times everything is perfectly understandable so that instead of learning theoretical details and definitions (which can also be found for those who want to learn more) you gain an intuition and true understanding of what is going on.",5
2115,"It is one of the best course for learning algorithms of machine learning,but make it sure that you have understanding of the data structures and algorithms implementations before taking this course,that will help you alot to understand all these algorithms.",5
2116,"Thank you professor Andrew Ng for this wonderful course on machine learning. Being completely new , after going through to your videos and assignments I gained much knowledge. I am sure that it will help me lot in my career. Another plus point is that  I came to know about 'Octave'. Thinking about vectorized solutions of problems was a fun. Hope I'll soon enroll in your other course as time permits. Leaning shall continue. Thanks a ton again.!!",5
2117,"The course teaches a wide range of state of the art machine learning techniques. There is a lot of practical advice on how to efficiently apply these techniques. The programming assignments are helpful in solidifying the knowledge you get from the lectures. One small problem is that, they didn't teach how to vectorize two of the learning algorithms. Overall, having finished this course I feel confident in building machine learning applications.",5
2118,Great Thanks to Coursera. Great Thanks to Andrew NG for kind explanation.,5
2119,"This course is tough... It heavily emphasizes the math (calculus, matrix algebra, linear algebra, statistics)  behind several machine learning algorithms. It will take about 3-4 times longer than advertised. But make no mistake, if you are serious about getting the best machine learning crash course on the internet you will come out on the other side with no regrets about the time you spend. It was a blessing to learn from Andrew Ng. Thank you!",5
2120,Great course to attend! It allowed me to discover machine learning algorithms and to see I use some variant of those algorithms in other mathematical problems in my job and studies. Andrew is a great pedagogue and it was a pleasure to listen his explanations. ,5
2121,"This was a phenomenal course. Professor Ng has a very approachable style, and the material is surprisingly easy to pick up, even if you lack a background in linear algebra or calculus. The programming exercises could be a bit redundant at times, but that helped the material sink in. There were also excellent optional exercises to help learn how to apply the techniques more deeply. Overall and excellent course and well worth the time investment. ",5
2122,"This has been an invaluable introduction to machine learning and I'd highly recommend anyone who's curious about the subject to take this course. Andrew made the material relatively easy to follow coming from a MechE background and now I feel much more knowledgeable on the topic. I'm really glad I took this course. Stick through it and really do the programming assignments and you'll get this stuff, no matter how difficult it may seem at first.",5
2123,"This was a really interesting and useful course! The instructor was good at explaining the concepts. The assignments were useful; Octave was a good choice and a language i had never used before. Some of the early lesson videos had audio problems, most could probably be solved with an automatic volume normalizer. Having a slightly slower pace option without switching sections would have been nice. Looking forward to doing another related course!",5
2124,"One of the best classes I have taken so far.  Andrew NG provides excellent intuition for the algorithms he covers.  Machine learning techniques like decision trees and ensemble methods which are not covered here. I would also like to recommend that - it's not a beginner's course. Previous experience in linear algebra and programming experience is required, otherwise you'll get stuck. So prepare well and must do this course. Huge recommendation!  ",5
2125,"While this course is 8 years old, there is nothing outdated about it and it is still one of the most important courses for a ML learner to take. In fact, I would recommend everyone to start their Machine Learning journey from this course - it will give a strong and comprehensive foundation, on which new skills can be built. Thanks to Andrew Ng and Coursera team for creating such an opportunity for us by creating this course and making it free.",5
2126,"I was new to machine learning and have not done a course like this for 20+ years. This course is structured very well -explaining concepts, discussing practical issues and introducing real-world problems.  The programming exercises focus on core learning and comes with skeleton code to read data and display results. No prior machine learning and data science experience is necessary, but a programming background helps with the coding exercises. ",5
2127,"This might be the best MOOC I have ever taken. The teaching was fantastic. I am not a computer science student but still I was able to learn everything that Ng has taught. The programming exercises were complicated and made me to invest a lot of time and effort but everything was worth it. As a student, this would course will certainly help in shaping my career-life in a good way. Thank you Stanford, Ng and Coursera for this phenomenal course. ",5
2128,"I have used algorithms through out my career but the notion that machines can learn was a bit vague for me until I took this course.  The fact that well designed algorithms can delve deep into the vector space and hyperplanes and tease out non-linear relationships is mind boggling, but that is what they can do faster than humans.  I would recommend this course to any future scientist so they can leverage new knowledge and avoid pitfalls of AI.",5
2129,"Its an awesome course for those just starting with Machine Learning. By this, I do not mean that the content is very basic. Rather it is the approach Prof. Andrew Ng has taken to explain such complex topic in simple manner that you feel at home. The course not only clears your basic doubts, it lets you solve problems by doing hands-on exercises. I would recommend this course for at all experience levels. Sincere thanks to Prof Ng and Coursera.",5
2130,"I am a sooftware engineer of GE healthcare. I do programming everyday during work. This class is really excellent, it is adressed in a very clear way, and before this class I know nothing about machine learning, and after putting myself into this class for almost 3 months, I learned many machine learning algorithms, how to apply machine learning algorithms into practice. By the way, I hope I could use these tools into practice or even at work.",5
2131,"Good range of topics covered, tests and assignments nicely reinforce video lectures. I agree with Prof Andrew Ng that Matlab/Octave reduce the learning curve - it made learning new concepts much less frustrating. ",5
2132,"I really enjoyed this course, Andrew Ng is a fantastic teacher and lecturer, and his explanations were capable of making very complicated topics extremely intuitive. As a result, learning machine learning through his course has been a much more fruitful and rewarding effort than self-learning through Wikipedia or other online sources. Loved this class, loved the teaching methods, loved the exercises - I don't have enough praise for this class.",5
2133,Classic and worthwhile course for beginner into ml.,5
2134,,5
2135,A great course. Subject is presented in a very elegant and formal way by professor Ng starting with basic things and advancing with perfect pace to more difficult things. I appreciated the focus on real life work of ML such as evaluating statistical models and optimizing teamwork effort and time.,5
2136,"This course gives me a lot of confidence and satisfaction about studying new areas. I know Dr. Ng skipped a lot of math and reasoning processes throughout the course and I never felt I am an expert of machine learning. But the most important thing is that I realize this is matter of practice, deliberate practice. I obtained the mindset as a programmer and background techniques of utilizing machine learning from this course. Keep working on it.",5
2137,This is by far the best online learning course. I learned so much from Prof Andrew Ng. I really appreciate it. Could have been better if we wrote all the codes from scratch but that would have taken longer time. Much informative. Next is to learn python and the sckit-learn libraries. I prefer Octave and MAtlab because you actually see and understand the algorithm and the basics of it. its not widely used though but very powerful. Thanks again.,5
2138,"The course is fairly broad without trying to touch upon and demonstrate everything, but it's also quite deep without geeting too far into the weeds. I thought the use of Matlab compared to other programming languages was questionable but the functionality of Matlab, particularly vectorization, helped illustrate the concepts better tha any other language I can think of. This is the best foundational machine learning course I've taken bar none.",5
2139,"Fue una experiencia de aprendizaje retadora, al inicio creí que tendría problemas para entregar las tareas de programación, sin embargo, todos los trabajos están perfectamente explicados y las guías para realizarlos son muy útiles. Recomendaría que el volumen de los videos fuese más alto, pues hubo varias ocasiones que intenté ver las lecciones sin audífonos y era muy díficil entender (no soy inglés nativo). Aún así me sirvió mucho. ¡Gracias!",5
2140,"Professor Ng is an incredibly gifted teacher. He explains difficult concepts gently and even reassures you when difficult concepts are confusing that he was also confused with the harder material at first, and is constantly learning. I very much look forward to applying my knowledge from this course in the near future, and plan on referring back to the slides and videos when I need refreshers. This is the best online course I have ever taken. ",5
2141,"After submitting my doctoral dissertation, I went off traveling and came back and there was still a month or two to kill waiting for my reviewers' comments. I didn't know what to do, the Mr.-to-Dr. transition limbo. I decided to build up my skills - chinese was too hard to master in 2 months. ML is easier. With Andrew Ng played at 1.75x speed and Tom Mosher's profile pic judging my inability to code, ML was more fun than expected. Cheers, Hud",5
2142,"This is a fantastic course for a working engineer. I love the practical approach to teaching theory, but with heavy emphasis on what you need to apply the knowledge. There's enough of the background to understand what's happening, but not a huge focus on formal proofs (and mostly just the result). This applied approach is very practical and valuable for people like me working in industry and looking for specific solutions to problems we face.",5
2143,,5
2144,,5
2145,,5
2146,"Andrew Ng dives right into the subject matter of this course yet provides real world samples of the applications of machine learning. The exercises provide significant challenge if you're rusty on calculus and completely new to this topic, so I would recommend joining a study group or creating one yourself. I would take this course again to refresh the concepts of machine learning, especially if it is revised to stay up to date in the future. ",5
2147,"everything about the course(the videos,lecture notes,tutorials,programming exercises,quizzes,etc) was really engaging,intresting and informative. I learnt a lot about machine learning.",5
2148,"Outstanding learning experience. Learnt a lot. The way the course is delivered to audience is so elegant but at the same time easy to understand. Thank Prof Andrew Ng for doing this course. He made some very hard concept of machine learning become easy to grab. I had been trying to self-studied machine learning from various of tutorials and research papers, but no method comes close to this one in terms of simplicity, quality. Thank so much.",5
2149,"Really amazing concepts being presented here, the best things about this course are the presenter (Dr Ng) explains the theories and practical concepts from the ground up and the mentors dont assume the background knowledge of students when answering questions in the forum (except of course the previous lectures materials). Well structured, very great and challenging quiz and assignments that get me think hard enough about the materials. 👍🏾",5
2150,Completing this course has been a wonderful experience! ,5
2151,"For sure, I am not the only one rating this course with 5 stars, I really learned a lot of new and useful things, regarding linear regression, supervised/unsupervised learning, bias/variance, neural networks (my initial motivation), SVM, etc. In fact many new things.",5
2152,I like the way this course is designed. The lectures are very articulate. The thing that impressed me most about the Professor is; Students who doesn't have sound calculus and vector algebra understanding also can complete this course easily. Assignments are application oriented and some are challenging too. The Questions in Quiz assignments are in such a way that they test your understanding of that particular lecture and the summary of it.,5
2153,"I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ng for such an excellent course. It helped me to get through such enlightening subject. The instructor was very clear. The contents and other support materials are well organized and satisfying. The programming assignments are suitable even for the ones who have little knowledge on MATLAB/Octave, since it is required only to fulfill the core parts. I hope finding more courses like this on Coursera.",5
2154,"I chose this course on Machine Learning out of many because is had the best rating. I was not disappointed in the least. Great balance between theory, mathematical foundations, programming exercises and practical advice on building real-life applications. I doubt that one can start developing enterprise-level applications after completing this course, but I think it's a necessary component of building a foundation in this area of expertise.",5
2155,Thank you professor for all your help and efforts that you've put in into the course. You are truly on of the best professors I've taken a class under and I surely will put all my knowledge i gained from here and everything that i learn from this moment onwards in machine learning for the best of the people and the society and the world around me. ,5
2156,"Excellent course! I have been introduced to the basic concepts of neural networks before in multiple contexts, but never really had a solid foundation to understand things well. Taking this course on machine learning has really solidified my foundation. I now feel more comfortable discussing and applying machine learning problems and applications. I didn't expect much from an online course, but this is very well formatted. Highly recommend.",5
2157,"The content of the course quality; clear intructive language, deep expertise, instructing capabilty and mathematical foundation of the instructor create great environment for advancing your understading on machine learning. Even I have solid foundation about data science and machine learning area; this course help me get different perspective when analysing machine learning algorithms during videos. Absolutely one of the best online course.",5
2158,"This course is to date the best Coursera course that I have taken, and it certainly rivals many of the courses I took on campus. Andrew Ng is a fantastic teacher and I look forward to taking more of his courses. I would also like to make special mention of the quality, thoughtfulness, preparation and structure of the programming assignments. They balanced time efficiency and depth in a remarkable way. Taking this course was time well spent.",5
2159,"The course outlined a few key algorithm when it comes to machine learning without going too deep into the mathematics. The mathematics would make a lot more sense to people who did linear algebra and/or advanced calculus, however Andrew Ng explained it in a way that makes it understandable for people who may not have the background in math. The most important thing that I learnt from this course are the intuitions behind all the algorithms. ",5
2160,"Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher, rich with information and experience, in the Machine Learning domain. His videos were easy to grasp and catered to varying student levels with Andrew affording special videos for advanced and amateur students alike. Apart from the great course content and its delivery, Andrew's enthusiasm is one of the highlights of this course with the student feeling rearing to go implement great things by the end of it.",5
2161,"I really liked the course has been developed and delivered by Prof Andrew Ng. The course is cleverly designed to accommodate people at different skill levels. While the videos, assignments and lecture notes are very valuable and free to access, it would be more encouraging for people to join the Machine Learning working community if the certificate fee is lesser than what it is now. Thanks to Coursera, Prof Andrew Ng and all the volunteers.",5
2162,"This is a Very Good course on Machine Learning from the beginner level to expert level. It gives clear knowledge and the math behind machine learning concepts and help you how one should think while solving such problems. It not only concentrates on the problems/algorithms of machine learning but also how to approach them, how to debug, how to analyze etc. Hope this helps. Thank you :)(Thanks to Coursera for introducing this course to me.)",5
2163,"Coming from a chemical engineering background, I'm not yet particularly adept within the realm of machine learning and it's various constituents. This course has proved valuable in bridging the gap in my understanding and has exposed me to a good basis of fundamental principles within the field and potential use cases and applications. The course is incredibly well put together, with a fair balance of theory and basic fundamental practice.",5
2164,"I took this course as a high schooler in my junior year, and, thanks to this course, I was not only able to pick up such an on-demand skill, but also was able to broaden and sharpen my mind due to the various insights provided by the professor. On top of that, the videos are succinct such that just a couple of hours on a weekend for a couple of weeks was all it took to pass this course. Thank you to the professor for this excellent course!",5
2165,"Splendid course! The explanation of relatively complex material was superB level. It was easy to grasp and fun to learn. The training excercies was at higest level and deserve a special thanks. I learned a lot from the source code included in exercises, especially visualisation of problems and curves for debugging alghortitms. It can be used as reference later after the course. Many thanks Andrew NG and team who make this course avaliable.",5
2166,"I enjoyed this course. Of course there were moments, when I felt that Programming task is too hard after watching training videos only once. Then I had to review them again. And you know what? It worked. Tasks seemed to become reasonably understandable. Also FAQ for Programming tasks were so much useful! I see this course as a solid base ground for my interest in ML. Best wishes and courage to everyone taking this course. It is worthwhile.",5
2167,"Very well structured course and exactly what I needed given that I had no exposure to Machine learning techniques before and wished to learn it always. Andrew explains each topic in very simple and effective way. The course content, quiz and programming exercises are very well structured to make the learning experience fruitful. Also Thank you to the Mentors - especially Tom Mosher, for guiding and spending their valuable time. Thank You.",5
2168,"Andrew Ng is a master at explaining complex concepts and putting them into real-world contexts. This course elaborates on all the essentials of machine learning in a steady and concise manner, allowing you to master the basics and advanced functions of Machine Learning. Each section is well-paced and the programming assignments are an added plus in order to understand these ML concepts from a practical perspective. Thoroughly recommended!",5
2169,"The content of the lecture is very brief for the students to follow. The exercises given in this course really help me to get a clear understand on the topics that were discussed. Me as a mechanical engineering student find this course really beneficial. The important point is that, I have actually grab the concept on how to work on with data, especially the way how we look at it. Thank you to Andrew Ng for guiding me through this course.",5
2170,"Great course! I like most the practical orientation of this course, not just dry theory which would far beyond usability. As it was done, one is able to directly start realizing real world problems. This was also the reason to start this course, not just due to academic interest.",5
2171,I am right now in middle of this course but I can surely say that if anyone looking for a way to enter in the world of Machine Learning then you are at the right place. Mr. Andrew is a guy who makes complex solutions and mathematical formlulas a piece of cake (not always though). Anyone with a keen interest in Machine Learning or anyone finding a way to a head start for it should definitely consider doing this course with full dedication.,5
2172,"Great course. Perfectly tailored for technical people, such as myself, who seek to ""see something working"" ASAP, and even start tuning it for real life challenges (at least a bit). There's an excellent balance, where on the one hand we don't delay on the finer theoretical details, but on the other hand we can still understand what we're doing & what's the basic mathematical intuition behind it. It takes a rare teacher to do that - thanks!",5
2173,"Excellent introduction to the wonderful topic of machine learning. I was able to use this class to find out a field of CS that I enjoy, and even apply the knowledge to my engineering internship to build an image classifier system. I will be taking my first university ML course in a few months, and I know the foundation I built from this class will help me greatly in my future endeavors. Thank you, Professor Ng, you are a great role model!",5
2174,,5
2175,Great material and tutor!,5
2176,"This course is unbelievable. It is great, full stop. Andrew Ng is a particularly skilled data scientist and a great lecturer. I will have to watch some videos over and over again because they are so full of important information that I believe someone cannot easily find on a textbook. To conclude, this course is highly suggested to those whom, like me, started as a complete beginner student of ML algorithms. Good luck and happy learning!",5
2177,"When i decided to take up this course was when i was told to take up this course, and by the time i completed i find myself in the loop of recommending it to my friends. No past experience in machine learning is required in taking up this course, and it gives you the confidence to opt for the specialization courses. As a student this course plays a vital role in my transformation from a beginner to as an intermediate in machine learning. ",5
2178,"Hello,",5
2179,This course is simply amazing.,5
2180,"This course is a piece of art. It is people who have been running from sites to sites looking for the perfect source to get started with machine learning just to end wasting weeks or months not finding a proper place to get started.This course covers it all from the math, implementation to intuition and most importantly experienced advice on how to implement a proper ML solution. It is something that most of the other courses fail to do.",5
2181,I loved this course primarily for the fact that it was easy to comprehend. I feel this course is suitable not only to professionals already in the industry for Machine learning but also for people who want to just start out into this field. The programming assignments and quizzes are designed in a way that they are solvable as long as you pay attention to the lectures and you have minimal/basic programming experience. Andrew is the best!,5
2182,"Such a great course! The technical ramp-up is great. There was some difficulty jump from the work to the assignments sometimes, but I like how I wasn't hand-held through the assignments and I had to really work out how it was all going on. The resources on the forums were also very helpful and the mentors were very good - so thank you to them. I can definitely recommend this course to anyone else thinking about learning machine learning!",5
2183,,5
2184,"I found this a very useful course for giving me a practical and theoretical introduction to machine learning.  I feel that I can now have educated discussions with peers about machine learning (I am a project manager working with software engineers), assess technologies that use machine learning, and where necessary actually conduct machine learning.",5
2185,"An excellent course, with well-presented study material, good supplementary resources, enjoyable and moderately sophisticated assignments (these usually took me more than the claimed 3 hours to accomplish, yet everything is solvable with a bit of thinking and attention). Recommended for anyone interested in conceptual foundations and basic topics of machine learning (elementary math and programming skills would be desirable).",5
2186,"Undoubtedly the best course on Machine Learning. It covers many important concepts, going deep, and having great assignments to use those concepts to solve the actual problems. One great thing I learned is how to figure out if my machine learning algorithm is giving me the right answers and what to do if I am going in the wrong direction.",5
2187,"I've started this course with no idea about what is machine learning and how it works. This course gives a lot of informations about machine learning from theorical to practice aspects, from mathematical to algorithmic aspect. This course was for me, one of the most interesting one that I was led to follow. ",5
2188,"Such a nice explanation of difficult concepts. What a wonderful teacher Andrew is. This class has very useful programming exercises. It has really helped me to understand the basics of different machine leaning algorithm and how to make use of it. Some of the useful example and practical guidance to evaluate your algorithm, corrections, identify the next steps for high bias and variance problems are amazing. Thanks alot for this course.",5
2189,Andrew is really great at explaining concepts and that is what matters the most. He gave us complete insights on how a problem needs to be worked out and this course is without any doubt THE BEST machine learning course on the internet. His frequent suggestions on how industry functions is icing to the cake. You actually develop actual real life thinking going through this course. I loved studying with Coursera and Andrew. Thanks a lot!,5
2190,"It was a great experience doing this course. It was an excellent introduction to machine learning for me. It was exciting to learn from the videos and programming exercises, that I wanted to get back to the course as much as possible and made time for it despite challenges with my schedule. Hopefully this will be a great stepping stone into the world of machine learning for me, since I am keen to take similar courses now and learn more.",5
2191,"I have never enjoyed an online course before this much. Not only I gain a lot of practical skills to apply ML skills but also it made me think a lot on the mathematical point of view and challenge me with the assignments (especially vectorization and regularization parts :D). Most importantly, I didn't google a single concept since every bit of the subjects were clearly explained and documented. ",5
2192,"One of the best, most enlightening, interesting and well produces courses I have ever taken online. Andrew is a great teacher and truly an expert in the subject. The course is very well structured, with the necessary theory and funny practical applications, some being quite challenging. If you want to know about the nuts and bolts on machine learning, this course is all you need. Thank you for such a great course and a great experience.",5
2193,"I was a wonderful experience. All the advanced concepts were made very simple and easy to understand. The assignments were made to cater to every level of students there exists. I personally did all the optional parts of the assignments and did some extra reading and even tried implementing in python. Once the concept was understood it was a lot easier to work, regardless of the language that was used to code. Overall it was really fun.",5
2194,"This is an excellent course for people staring out in Machine Learning. Professor Andrew does a great job of hand-holding you and helping you navigate a mathematically rigorous and tough subject like Machine learning and helps to build your confidence. This Course is good for beginners in ML, but to become an expert you would have put in a even more effort at learning and drilling down all the concepts. ",5
2195,"BEST! Best course ever. Not only dedicated to Machine Learning, not only on Coursera. BEST course I've ever watched, listened, learned. I want to say thanks to Andrew Ng for his work because He and his course inspired me to start learning ML and gave me good knowledge basis. I wish I could some day shake his hand and say ""Thank you"" personally.",5
2196,"The course is a ""Life - Changer"" ! Andrew Ng is the best professor I have ever had. He is the reason I have decided to pursue my masters in machine learning. He breaks a complex concept down into chunks which are simpler to understand and thereby explaining that concept. I feel like I can apply this knowledge to any domain, be it robotics, finance, biology, etc. Do go for this course, because it'll change your life. It has changed mine. ",5
2197,"Like the millions of other reviews, this class is a great foundation for ML.  Andrew discusses a broad array of topics with it's real-life applications.  It's a great balance between theory and real world applications which makes each lesson very motivational.  Andrew does a great job of simplifying most of the math associated with the algorithms and provides motivation to revisit my numerical analysis and linear algebra understanding!",5
2198,"Absolutely loved the course, learned a lot, the mentors in discussion and guided tutorials, everything was very helpful and the conclusion video made me cry and feel super accomplished.",5
2199,"This is a fantastic course that allows someone with little to no machine learning experience to be able to easily grasp elementary concepts. It's been a fun ride these past 11 weeks! But like they say, all good things must come to an end. However, for every ending, there's a new beginning. I'm now even more excited to take other ML courses and slowly build up up my appreciation for the pioneers who have made it possible! Thanks Andrew!",5
2200,"the best $79 ever spent!  a well-design class, with material building on each week's learning.  thoughtful programming assignments help with gaining understanding of theoretical material.  not an easy class, requires dedicated hours, which comes with the territory of machine learning field.  huge thank you to the instructor, Andrew Ng, for super explanations of complicated material!  no wonder he's famous in the data science community.  ",5
2201,This course was really helpful for people who want and need to know intuition of machine learning. Not only intuition of machine learning this course included mathematical back drop of each of them. Not only be taught by explanation but also you need to confirm some algorithm by programing by yourself.  Don't worry if you have little knowledge of math and programming same as me there are mentors in discussion forums you can ask  help.,5
2202,I am very satisfied with this online course and will definitely recommend it to others who are also interested and want to get started in machine learning. After the course i have now a complete understanding of ML. I find the programming training very good and useful. It helps me understand the content better and gives me an basic idea about how to apply it in practice.,5
2203,"This is an absolutely amazing class. I would definitely recommend anyone who is interested in machine learning to take part in it. I came from a programming background and was worried about the Maths side of it, Especially as I have not completed 2nd level education so do not have much experience with linear algebra or calculus. But this class covers both those things in great detail. Andrew Ng's videos are great and very encouraging!",5
2204,"Great course for starting to learn machine learning. Gives a very nice and neat introduction and insights into the subject. In spite of being an introductory class, it covers quite a bit. Also, Andrew Ng clearly enjoys teaching and does this very well (Thank you, Andrew!), He covers with a lot of patience and attention all the subtle terms and gives a huge amount of his own obviously vast insight. Really a privilege to learn from him.",5
2205,"Andrew Ng is an amazing professor. He not only teaches you the different machine learning algorithms, but teach you when to use each one, pros vs cons, regularization, parameter tuning, how the debug and visualize your data in order to know how you can improve your algorithm, and show real use cases.",5
2206,"I had previously learned some of this material in previous courses I had taken years ago in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, however this course provided a much better explanation on how and why these techniques work.  The concise presentation style of the mathematics, the inclusion of system design in the syllabus, and the construction of the practical exercises (using Matlab) were all very well done and much appreciated.",5
2207,The best way to start learning machine learning. Considering this course as an introduction to machine learning this course serves much better and big purpose by covering almost all basic  concepts and giving complete and clear insight in whatever topic it does take up. This is far more expected from any basic introductory courses. Enjoyed a lot and looking forward for many courses to take up from the inspiration given by this course,5
2208,"Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, it is a very good course and the best/top instructor to take the course respectively. It has lucid explanation of the concepts and it is very nicely put and presented. The interface also is very good and overall, it has made me come back and study this concepts and enhance this skills, as soon as I get back next day. I also thank, Andrew Ng to have me as his student and to inspire and teach this course.",5
2209,"Me ha encantado el curso, me ha picado bastante la curiosidad y verdaderamente creo que adquieres unos conocimientos bastante prácticos por si te incorporas a este mundillo, sobretodo, el cómo lidiar con los problemas de aprendizaje. Supongo que un curso de 56 horas no ha dado tiempo de dar algo de redes neuronales convolucionales, aprendizaje reforzado, GANs ... , ya hubiera sido la guinda, pero aún así lo recomiendo, ¡felicidades!.",5
2210,"Very good, detailed course. Topics were complicated but were boiled down very well most of the time. The struggle and frustration at some of the programming exercises (backpropagagtion) were well worth it because i felt a sense of accomplishment after completing them. This course taught me a ton, and if i ever become a successful programmer in the future, a big part of that success would be attributed to this course and to Andrew Ng. ",5
2211,"Perfect course! I even couldn't predict, before startring it, it will excite me so much. First of all, almost every detail works very good, I mean there are very useful videos by on the most professional people in machine learning, effective system of checking your understanding, very spectecular programm assignments. Secondly, this course consisits of fundamental materials and practical tasks at the same time. Thanks a lot for this!",5
2212,"Although I'm new to these concepts in Machine Learning, professor Andrew Ng made the contents very approachable by his clear and straightforward explanations. The course is very interactive with short questions popping up in the lectures, discussions in the forum and quizzes after every section to make sure the lessons were made clear. The only problem is that the audio is sometimes a bit hard to hear. But besides that, great course.",5
2213,"I have been working on tools to analyse data and find anomalies visually. Now machine learning has helped me automated them to a great accuracy! Thanks to Andrew and Team for providing this course. This course is very well organized, and is covering various aspects of machine learning. This gave me an overview of various algorithms available, how to pick them, implement them, debug them and tune them. Once again, thank you very much.",5
2214,"Great and thorough course, especially if you are a beginner like me in the field of machine learning. Totally recommended to anyone and everyone who is looking for guidance to develop their career in the field of data science and want to learn about all famous and not-so famous techniques. Andrew has put his heart out in developing the course videos and making sure he covers all his valuable experience in as simple form as possible. ",5
2215,"This is the first online course that I ""complete"" in my life (although I haven't taken the programming tasks). It makes me feel that it is a quite enjoyable experience to learn knowledge.

Perfect for students looking to better understand Machine learning and when it is best to use this or that algorithm or optimization techniques. ,5
2217,"This course the machine learning course opened the door of the mathematics' application, the statistics theory's application, the machine learning's application, even the advanced application pilotless automobile. I'm a software developer on information system industry. This course is so exciting for me.But it also confused me. Can I really go further along the way of AI.Anyway I will start the deep learning course of coursera soon.",5
2218,"Excellent content, well thought quizzes and real life exercises. I loved the organization and flow of content.",5
2219,"This course is amazing. I learnt a lot of new concepts and got a good clarity on most machine learning algorithms. I had gone through several other courses on machine learning offered by different other websites, but i often find myself looking at these algorithms as just a blackbox, where we get a result if we feed it data, not knowing what's going on inside. Thanks to this course, i have a better understanding of these algorithms.",5
2220,Thanks very much for Andrew's class for machien learning. I'm a beginner of machine learning and this is the first class I take for machine learning.

I feel Andrew opens a hopeful gate for me and strenthens my confidence about mchine learning. Thanks very much again for andrew's excellent explanation for machien learn,5
2221,"I liked this course very much. Not only that it presented the mathematical background in a very understandable fashion, but also that it was shown how to judge how well or not well the implementation worked and what needs to be done to improve it.",5
2222,"This course was a fantastic, and challenging experience. Reflecting on how it felt to be a student during the first few weeks, compared to now, it is obvious that a lot of learning and synthesis took place. Not having the mathematical or computer science background that one might expect for this type of work, I literally didn't know if I would make it through this. It was extremely well guided, and the mentor support was invaluable.",5
2223,"I truly enjoyed the class. Andrew Ng is extremely good in providing a valuable intuition and demonstrating the main ideas and critical points of the methods. As I am a mathematician I often missed more rigorous and detailed mathematical derivations and argumentations. However, I very well understand that the class is meant to address a general audience with probably no further mathematical understanding than that obtained at school.",5
2224,This Machine Learning Course is the best start for a beginner as it teaches you from Zero to Advanced. Completed my course in a duration of 11 weeks since it requires your time and dedication. This program is purely based on the Coding platform MATLAB and GNU/Octave.,5
2225,"One of the best course materials to start with machine learning. This course has covered most of the topics in machine learning in detail. Not just the algorithms, also the ways to check the efficiency of our implementation and ways to improve the accuracy of predictions. After completing this, one will know to connect the dots for a machine learning problem and improve the accuracy easily. Thank you so much Andrew and the mentors! ",5
2226,"Prof Andrew Ng is truly a luminary in the field of machine learning and is a masterful teacher. Without a doubt, one of the best ways to step into the world of Machine Learning.

Besides, both the scheduling and difficulty are proper. In the end, thanks to all who has help me to solve some problem.",5
2230,I have taken this course few weeks back and my understanding in the area of machine learning and AI has boosted up at a very good level. The video lectures and notes given are very helpful. PDF notes are very useful as a quick reference to any topic or equation. I thoroughly appreciate Mr. Andrew Ng has explained very difficult algorithms in a lucid way. I am looking forward to do more courses in this field on coursera. thank you !,5
2231,"Le premier cours de la plateforme Coursera, et non des moindres. Un super mélange de :",5
2232,"I have a PhD in control engineering, and this course is one of the best course I have studied or have still been studying. It is so well-instructured, defined with good examples and quizes,. I liked even some parts that I knew about  it, i.e. lsimilar to readia good/deep novel that making you conscious about details, and widing a subject about life that you maybe already know but not so deeply and sweet. ",5
2233,"This is one of the best machine learning courses there are. Where most of the other courses just skimp directly to the language-specific implementation part of the algorithms, this course digs deep into the details of how it works, the maths behind it and how to finally implement it. This is the first course you should be doing if you are just the beginner or want to actually understand what, why, when and how of Machine Learning. ",5
2234,"The course is superb and Prof. Andrew Ng's teaching style is informal, informative and easy to follow. Thanks for helping me to understand enough machine learning to know that I plan to learn more and apply it in daily business as an IT architect in the leading Swiss Telco, where AI, Machine Learning & Big Data are at the center of a strategy to transform the company into a data-driven company and compete in today's digital world.",5
2235,"Thanks a lot to you Professor Andrew Ng! Thank you for walking me through the techniques of machine learning and the methods to apply it to daily problems.

This course gave me lot of confidence and encouraged me to learn more. I would thank you Andrew and team many a times who has put together such a great course. I will do all other courses by you and also wish to meet you sometime! Thanks - Ravi       ",5
2237,This was a great course !!!,5
2238,"When I joined this course, I was one of the people fascinated by the idea of machine learning, but with no clue whatsoever as to what it really meant.",5
2239,"Completing this course is a thrill.  While I have studied this math earning my computer science degree, it's been a very long time since these memories have been of value - I'm currently in a IT Director role at a foods manufacturing company.  This course is an excellent starting point on a journey to use machine learning to solve real problems.  Many thanks to Andrew Ng and Coursera for this excellent course, it was a lot of fun.",5
2240,"Phenomenal course! Andrew's explanations are clear and concise. I know feel I am able to better work with Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. I know I can correctly code then and debug them, in a manner that is effective and correct. I hope Andrew teaches many more course like this one. I really hope new students take interest in this course as it is an amazing resource, a free resource which is priceless this day in age.",5
2241,This course taught by Andrew Ng is by far the best introductory course to ML. It does not go into 300 level and above depth but the fundamentals of mathematics and algorithms are covered in the most comprehensive manner. Hands-on lab was helpful to ensure you understood the theory. I highly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning ML or for those who need a refresher to some of the concepts of ML algorithms/,5
2242,"This was the first online course I ever learned. Helped me a lot to understand the concepts well. Mr.Andrew Ng is a very good instructor, thanks to him and Coursera team for this wonderful initiative. And what I would like to suggest to the beginners is that at first, you may find it difficult but if you have an enthusiasm for understanding how these things work never stop..gradually by learning you will get the whole picture !!!",5
2243,"Este ha sido, y por mucho, el mejor curso on-line que he realizado en mi vida. Para mi ha sido un honor introducirme en el mundo del Machine Learning de la mano de una leyenda como Andrew N.G. ¡Muchas gracias por este curso!",5
2244,"The instructor provided very well guided track for understanding the Machine learning concepts. I would highly recommend others to do programming exercises. These assignments improve the understanding of the concepts taught in the course. Also, the resources/discussion forums are very helpful in getting the help. Though I did not participate in the discussion forum, if someone has the bandwidth, I would highly encourage to do so. ",5
2245,This course is designed in a way that students can understand the topics easily. All the videos are very precise and other materials are also very useful to understand the topics better. I will definitely recommend this course to all machine learning enthusiasts and I can vouch that it will help them in understanding machine learning and it's practical applications in the real world. A Big Thank You to Andrew Ng for all the work.,5
2246,"really help me a lot which tells me what is the machine learning, and throughout the exercise, i can myself with the guide, make a good machine learning programme. that is cool when you build something can make a difference. love the class, love the disccussion which student and mentor talk, and that help me a lot when i meet some hard question, and help me solve some problem, sometimes which takes me some hours without outcomes.",5
2247,"This class is outstanding!!! Dr. Andrew Ng not only covered a good range of machine learning algorithms, important concepts and practice advice to applying the course material, he manages to do so in a very accessible manner, and was able to explain difficult concepts in such a way that a lay-person would understand. Exceptional communicator and teacher!!! Please keep such courses coming! This is invaluable stuff. THANKS SO MUCH!",5
2248,Absolutely beautiful course. Such a strong mathematically oriented course is taught in a way that it is easy to grasp and follow along.  Couldn't have asked for a better teacher than Andrew Ng. ,5
2249,"I find it a very high quality course. It introduced the scientific concepts, the programming hints and even the complicated mathematical proofs in a simple _yet rich and sufficient_ way. The programming assignments and their explaining documents are on a professional level. I want to deeply thank each and every one who worked honestly on this course, above all, the amazing Andrew Ng, I wish to take more courses instructed by you.",5
2250,This is an excellent course. The amount of effort that Professor Andrew Ng has put with so much patience is commendable and inspiring as well. My deepest gratitude to the professor for having such a world view / life view about openly sharing all his knowledge for the benefit of others and to promote this field. It inspired me to persevere and finish this course diligently. BIG THANKS again for imparting such wonderful education.,5
2251,Excellent course.  ,5
2252,Probably the best starting point for anyone entering the field of ML. You do not need to be a skilled statistician or Calculus expert to complete the course. All concepts neatly explained in a step by step manner & made interesting with quizzes and Assignments to test your skills. I enjoyed doing this course and will recommend it to all beginners. Prof. Ng has the skill to teach and I look forward to viewing more of his courses.,5
2253,"Excellent overview of machine learning problems and solutions. The course teaches the introductory mathematics behind machine learning, assuming a background in linear algebra. The lecture discussions give context around the solutions, but mainly focus on results, e.g. the algorithm for back propagation is given without formulation or proof. Personally I found it to be a very good balance of mathematical insight and application.",5
2254,"I want to thank the Instructor of this course, ""Mr. Andrew Ng"", from the depth of my heart for putting his significant efforts in the course. I have learned from the very basics to the advanced concepts of Machine Learning in this course. Now, I am much confident about my skills in Machine Learning. I also want to thank the Discussion Forum and Resource-providing community for all their efforts and guidance. Thank you very much. ",5
2255,"This course is an excellent one if you want an easy overview of Mahcine learning. It was a good introduction to this world but  I have to say, as a physcist, I would have prefered deeper maths in some parts but I undertsnad this course is made for everyone no matter his or her background. The professor is  really goo.d but I have to say that sometimes it was boring watching the slides while he was speaking (just my opinion :) ).",5
2256,"The speaker, respected Andrew Ng, really wants us to know, learn and apply machine learning algorithms in real world problem and applications. Course may seek patience from you since there are times when there are lot of maths coming in, formulas that you might not understand at first, etc. But if you only have dedication to learn or gain knowledge, it is one of the best course out there on the online learning community. Cheers!",5
2257,"The tutor is very experienced and he understand exactly how to train a student. The flow of course is very helpful. Video Tutorial->Reading Material->Quiz->Assignments. The best part is that we do not need to carry pen, paper to make any kind of notes. They provide all the slides that was used during teaching in videos. Moreover there is also short notes available after each lecture which helps to navigate the topic very easily.",5
2258,"This course provides me (re)introduction to machine learning. Yes, without linear algebra, matrices, probability, a bit of calculus, it is not easy. But in first week of this course, Mr. Ng provide sufficient materials for these topics needed in assignments. And I hope that I'll find ways to use machine learning not only to make my life better but maybe someday to use it to make many other people's life better as well. ",5
2259,"Very instructive. Every notion is explained very clearly and illustrated by enough examples. For those of us who love mathematics, the intuitive and mathematical concepts are detailed when they're not too far beyond the scope of the course.",5
2260,"Thank you, Sir! ",5
2261,"If there's one man whom I'd credit, for teaching machine learning to the world: it is Andrew Ng. This man, through teaching Machine Learning and through building this wonderful platform: Coursera, has gained more respect than most people on Earth today. This is the best course I've done so far, no doubt about it. I salute you, sir, for your efforts.",5
2262,"This course is pretty old. There are lots of new technologies and some advancement carries in the field of machine learning. But, I still like it because the core part is explain very well. Thank You, Professor, for your efforts. if this course available on python, then it will be too good. Ar the last summary videos, I couldn't able to believe that the course is completed. It's too fun during the course. Keep it up, professor.",5
2263,"There are many machine learning courses online that will teach you how to hit the ground running. But the way Andrew Ng and this course teaches you machine learning, you will be equipped to understand what is running under the hood of even complicated machine learning algorithms and toolkits. I am so thankful this course exists as it allowed me to understand machine learning at a fundamental level without being so intimidating.",5
2264,"Fantastic, both ML course content & Andrew Ng for ML's fundamentals learning. It is suggested to consider small programming questions as assignments rather than multiple m files. I am a working professional, hence it took me one & a half (half extra) sessions to complete the course.  Also, I feel that the latest updation in the syllabus is necessary for the upcoming sessions. ",5
2265,"The most inspiring teacher I have ever seen. Sir Andrew Ng is so humble, the way he teaches is so nice and I really respect him a lot. I am not sure if this message reaches to him or not, but I really wish to meet him in person with all my heart. I have developed my interest in Machine Learning because of only and only you, Sir Andrew. Will surely take up his further specialization courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. ",5
2266,"I actually audited a machine learning class when I was a student. My initial goal to take this class was just to get myself familiar with those concepts. It turned out very fun to take this class. I never thought that all those complicated concepts can be explained so clearly. Doing all those 8 programming projects was not a pain at all (not like when we were students), all those projects helped me understand the concepts more. ",5
2267,"I can highly recommend this course for anyone that is either completely new to Machine Learning or needs a refresher after a period of not dealing with the matter. As the latter, I would have liked a little fewer repetitions of certain details and more emphasis on the math, however, the practical advice given in this course made it invaluable anyways. Many thanks to Andrew Ng for being a great and wonderfully inspiring teacher.",5
2268,What I really loved about this course was that it was oriented towards use of the algorithms in practice.  The parts about learning curves was really interesting and I hope as useful as Andrew says they are. ,5
2269,"Absolutely fantastic. I've tried to do a lot of online courses over the last year or so, and every single one of them failed in the same part: The programming languages (or environments) never worked as expected. And I thought with this course it would be no different, but I enrolled either way. And how wrong was I!!!! Everything worked well from day 1. No time lost trying to make things work (except my code, of course hahaha).",5
2270,"Este es un curso excelente en el que Andrew enseña de una manera excepcional diferentes temas relacionados con el Aprendizaje Automático. Es altamente recomendable para todas las personas que quieran aprender sobre ML no solo desde un punto de vista teórico sino también práctico, ya que las actividades de programación que incluye el curso te ayudan a aprender como se implementa un sistema de ML utilizando diferentes algoritmos.",5
2271,"Andrew Ng opens the Machine Learning world in an easy to understand way. Note - this course doesn't require any prerequisites, but understanding advanced mathematics (calculus) and programming languages is required to be successful. You may be able to learn these as you go or simply watch the videos and not ""pass"" the course, but I would spend some time practicing these skills before this course if you want the full experience. ",5
2272,"Excellent course. Difficult at the start, especially if you have not looked at math symbols and statistics formulae in a while, but worth pushing through. I tend not to move on until I completely understand something but with this course it was best for me to accept some of the formulae as truth and move on. Eventually I started seeing the light, and towards the end of the course I got what was going on in the earlier lectures.",5
2273,"Andrew Ng is a true genius. Explaining such complicated topics in a comprehensible and intuitive way is something that not everybody is capable of. For those who are unhappy with having too little practice during this course, please don't forget that most of your success depends solely on yourself, regardless of what you learn or what you do. Your teacher's job is to show the guidelines, the rest is on you. Many thanks Andrew!",5
2274,This course has been designed and executed very well for someone having no background in Machine Learning. That makes this course the best suited course to dig in something new and fascinating. The course exercises in octave are engaging enough to give a practical understanding. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone wants to understand the buzz around Machine learning and have a meaningful understanding of the same.,5
2275,"Professor Ng provides a clear explanation on every topic. He makes it easy for someone, learning outside of their core discipline, to understand and apply topics of machine learning. Also, the course mentors provide great tutorials and support in completing the programming assignments. This is a very well-designed course.",5
2276,"Exceptional course and Andrew is one of the best instructors I have ever come across. I learnt a lot on this course and he also helped me build intuition around a lot of these concepts. The programming exercises are absolutely relevant and essential to getting a gut feel for each topic. Perfectly designed and executed, it demands rigor but rewards the student with the best insight out there from a practitioner and academician. ",5
2277,"I really learned a lot from this class. Beside my graduate school work, Andrew Ng's material on ML further boosts my confidence in working as a business analyst and the ability to solve complex machine learning programming problems. Though this course made me struggle a lot, I still wish this course can go on so I can still listen to his lecture. I will probably take some of his other courses in the future.",5
2278,"This course gives a very good understanding on machine learning. It was very nice to have the programming exercises reinforce the material and also force us to build the main components of machine learning modules instead of just using pre-built modules. As someone who is very new to the concepts of machine learning, I feel like the course was very practical and informative, but still taught at a very easy to understand level.",5
2279,Very great course. I really enjoyed every topic given in this course and Andrew and hist team did a great job in bringing this course to life.,5
2280,"Before starting this course I noticed some people complaining there is too much octave programming in it. My thoughts are there is exactly as much octave programming in it as there should be. In fact, now that I have completed the course, I do not see a better way of getting a good grasp of Machine Learning than to delve into some octave programming - and I am an experienced Java programmer with zero prior knowledge of octave.",5
2281,"I'm amazed at how much I've learned from this course. The depth of delving into the subject, spot on analogies and examples to clarify sometimes very esoteric-sounding concepts, overall combined into a very pleasant and satisfying learning experience. Even though the examples were executed in Octave, I believe it's a great prelude to taking some more modern and python/tensorflow-oriented courses by Andrew from deeplearning.ai.",5
2282,"Excellent course, I have enjoyed it a lot throughout the entire set of videos, especially the assignements.",5
2283,"It is first class I learn from the coursea, I think i will be the best class, Thanks Andrew Ng,Thanks coursea! I will strong recommend this to my classmates ,colleagues and friends who want o learn Machine learning. And the coursea  is a very good website, If it can deploy the servers  in China , It will be better for the Chinese, even though I don't have extra money to purchese the certificate, in the further , I would do it. ",5
2284,"Really interesting course that covers the basic introduction, a range of algorithms and techniques, and also advice for implementing them, ranging from code optimisation tricks and advice for what to focus on improving when implementing these things in the real world. Really interesting, and very well taught and presented and the programming exercises are good at illustrating the things you've learnt. Would strongly recommend.",5
2285,"This is the first machine learning course I have ever taken, Dr Andrew turns out to be the best teacher I've ever met even I took all my teachers during my 7 years in university. I've learned a lot of ML knowledges in an easy way, Andrew is the kind of person who is able to give you easy explanations out of a hard problem definition, I truly thank what Andrew has done for this course and I wish everyone learn from this course.",5
2286,Very simply put. Covers just the right amount of math to ensure concepts are internalized and yet course not made super technical. Allows people of all levels to attend and take away enough from the course to get started or even manage a team of other developers who would in turn need technical details. ,5
2287,,5
2288,Andrew Sir tries his best to teach everything possible and to make good use of his advice I would suggest anyone taking this class to put your own efforts too and  try to at least learn as many concepts possible (matlab/octave can be hard but still try to get a nice intuition of why it happens if you can' code yourselves ) .This is certainly the  best class  I have attended in some time and a good start to anyone's ML journey,5
2289,"The course is very well organized with topics with increasing levels of challenges.  Professor Ng's lectures cover all significant areas in ML, and are clearly presented with detailed explanations and examples.  The programming exercises offer great opportunities for students to learn by doing.  If you get stuck for too long, the classroom forum is a useful resource to help you move forward.  I'd highly recommend this course!",5
2290,"I have been working for about 20 years without using math too much and forget quite a lot of mathematical knowledge, it is quite a bit brain challenging for me to go through this class, but I'm glad I'm be able to complete this course, the course is not only helping me work wise, also help me overcome the fear to learn some hard but advanced topics like Machine Learning, thanks Andrew, great presentation, great online course!",5
2291,"A good mixture of theory and practice. Prof Ng presents complex topics in an easy to understand format without diluting the underlying theory. Octave is a powerful platform especially its Matrix capabilities. The resources created by course moderators, FAQ and practice examaples are very valuable. Only one minor downside is that there are some inaccuracies in the video which you have to figure out by going through the errata.",5
2292,"This was my first ever online course and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute
of it. There were days when I would be so excited and look forward to the next
video. All thanks to Prof. Andrew's teaching, very calm demeaner and reassuring us every
step of the way. Thank you to the Coursera team to making learning experience effertless.",5
2293,"Great class and great professor. In all honestly,  ndrew Ng is probably one of the best professors I have ever had. I really enjoyed his teaching style. It was very humble and informative. Some of the concepts were quite difficult and took quite a bit of time to get through. I came away from this with a better understanding of machine learning. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning.",5
2294,"It's an awesome, pretty fundamental course (there are total lack of fundamental knowledge in the area of data science so people are absolutely unable to be more effective than a monkeys which are pressing to create a neural network without a bit of understanding). I'm recommending it to the huge variety of people, especially for beginners and those who are not understand what they are really doing. Thank you so much for this!",5
2295,"This course is far better than the ones i have paid for on other online service providers. Instead of sticking with a language, Andrew spends time explaining the core concepts of Machine Learning/Data analytics with Matlab which are more useful then spending time explaining languages and packages. This course is recommended to anyone that has interest in learning real world applications of statistics/polynomials and calculus.",5
2296,"This course was truly great.  The videos were very clear. The mobie app  was very useful for watching or rewatching videos. The downloadable slides really helped. The pop up questions are effective at ensuring understanding. The quizes are challenging. The programming is difficult and rewarding - and would have been impossible without the Forums and especially the Forum tutorials, test cases and advisors. Thank you very much!",5
2297,"Machine Learning @ Coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng is just the perfect course. Prof. Ng is at the top of the field and a really talented teacher, I greatly appreciated this experience and I feel I can strongly advice this course to everyone interested in ML, AI, Big Data or even with just an interest in Computer Science or Applied Math. The coding excercises, though demanding, where fun (and useful). I wish there could be more...",5
2298,"Professor Andrew Ng taught the theory with the right amount of math and explained the concepts with great intuition. The lecture slides, quizzes and assignments are carefully drafted to give good amount of information along with hands on experience. I was a complete novice to Machine Learning and now after completing this course I have gained a lot of knowledge and the course has left me with greater interest in this subject. ",5
2299,"After digging around in the MOOC world for a bit in search of a more current course, I came to the conclusion that this course is still the best. Reasons are it offers a solid theoretical foundation, and it doesn't use all the built-in libraries when it comes to implementing the core concepts. I feel confident that I can now tackle a more current course with a better idea of what goes on behind the hood. A truly great course!",5
2300,An excellent introduction to Machine Learning for a beginner like me. Fortunate to have teachers like Andrew NG imparting their knowledge to the common people across the globe.,5
2301,"This is a very great course, presented in a way that every other course should be presented.

2436,Very easy to follow and learn. I know that you try to disclose before the begining of the video when sometimes it can be skipped. One thing that maybe could be improved would be to make clearer the level required in the field to skip the video. I was not always sure what level would be required so I kept on watching everything even though some concepts were simple for someone who had studied basic matrix concepts.,5
2437,"The best decision i made was to take up this course, it is correctly-paced and if you dedicate much time in a day work on it regularly this course can be completed soon enough, like in 4 weeks.

Some of the quiz, especially for the multiple choices (check all apply) is a little bit challenging and it will be better if the explanation could be provided. And it also will be better if some of the references (text book, articles) regarding the algorithm and mathematical derivation is provided.",5
2496,Andrew is a fantastic lecturer and I have really enjoyed learning the concepts of machine learning under is expert guidance. The course was extremely rewarding and I look forward to applying what I have learnt. The Coursera platform is also fantastic and the whole process was extremely simple in terms of submitting Tests as well as the programming exercises. Thank you Andrew for providing this amazing course. ,5
2497,I am getting started on Machine learning journey. I am happy and very grateful to have found this and started with this course. It provided me overall perspective on various machine learning algorithms and their possible application areas.  I sure hope to be able to build on this knowledge and be able to apply to real life examples. Thank you Andrew Ng for setting me up for furthering my skills in this field.,5
2498,"The Materials, in fact, are not that difficult compared to other in school ML classes I took. However, the greatest thing of this course is that it helps me understand a lot of algorithms which I did not catch well in class. The technical parts of algorithms are not taught in detail, but a way to show and learn. Very good for either an ML starter or those who are confused about what they learnt in real class.",5
2499,"I love this course. Although it contains many basic ideas and fundamental lessons, all are stated, and explained very well. Without understanding those things, it's difficult to gain a keen insight as well as further research on Machine Learning. Thank you instructors, and Coursera team for running this course regularly. And not forget to mentioned Prof. Andrew Ng. for his great contribution to our community.",5
2500,"One of the best courses I ever had. Be it the comprehensiveness of the content, the explanation of material or the applications of the same both in academic as well as industrial scenarios, it is by far one of the best taught courses. Thank you so much professor for posting this course. This will definitely add a lot of positive in the lives of those who will be privileged enough to undergo it. Thanks again.",5
2501,"Muy pero que muy completo. Muchas de las cosas que se dan las conocía de oídas, pero el poder indagar más tanto desde el punto de vista teórico como el práctico hace que este curso sea de los más interesantes. Los ejercicios de programación no son tan tan complicados, aunque si hay que echarle rato ahsta que te salen. Aun así, estan muy bien planteados y te ayudan muchisimo a aplicar la teoría a la práctica.",5
2502,"This course is a good starting point if you want to understand machine learning algorithms. It has everything: thorough theory, good explanations, knowledge checks and programming practice tasks to play with real example ML algorithms and see how different parameters affect the outcome (prediction). I thoroughly recommend this course to everyone who is starting to study machine learning and its applications.",5
2503,"One of the best courses I have taken so far. Machine learning course, by Andrew Sir, gives an enriching and a very exciting journey in the field of machine learning.

Great work Andrew Sir, loved your course!",5
2504,Great tutorial on Machine Learning. Initially it took me a while to understand the concepts but as the course progress everything started making sense. Quiz at the end of the session enabled me to brush up what I learned and in order to pass those test I need to revise intensively.,5
2505,"Course material is amazing, Mr. Andrew is amazing. As an EE graduate with programming, signal processing and linear algebra background, I was able to understand %90 of the course material perfectly and still be able to apply the %10 that I didn't quite get. Even people with less background will be able to apply ML solutions with this course. I loved the approach in the programming assignments as well. 5/5 :)",5
2506,This was my first course to machine learning and I learned a great deal from it. I feel that I am ready to start investing my time to apply the learnings at my current job. The lectures were of right duration and content was presented in a very simple manner. One thing I liked specifically is that the course covered the basics of machine learning algorithm instead of using libraries that abstract algorithms.,5
2507,"I found this course amazing and learned so much from it. The lectures were smartly arranged, followed by the well-designed assignments. While working on the assignments, I felt that the guidelines are leading me step-by-step to implement what I have learned and find the solution. I am amazed by the huge effort of people who brought this brilliant material to the world. Every thing was perfect, thank you all!",5
2508,A first class overview of machine learning algorithms and use-cases was provided. Even without having a background in computer science the programming tasks could be solved in an adequate amount of time. In combination with the lectures and the support resources for the exercises one could solve even complex programming tasks. Nevertheless the math behind all the algorithms presented was taught very clearly.,5
2509,"Excellent Machine Learning course. Topics are very interesting, lectures are great and have perfect length for a busy person. Andrew is really great teacher and he explains everything in such a way you understand it easily even if you haven't had any prior experience in this field. In my opinion this course have very nice structure and week schedule is really more than doable for a busy working professional.",5

2513,The standard for intro to machine learning. Everyone recommends this as a first start.,5
2514,"It is worthwhile to spend your time and energy on this course if you're interested in this field. Prof. Ng has prepared many materials, including application cases in Silicon Valley, to illustrate the essence of machine learning. During the lectures, he was stick to the basic optimization concept, to minimize the cost function under constraints, which could answer many theoretic questions posed by beginners.",5
2515,I would have loved to use numpy to process the exercises. Working with octave/matlab increase the effort because of the slightly different syntax in performing common matrix operations.,5
2516,This is a great course for persons who want to learn little deeper on Machine Learning theories. Andrew Ng is one of the best AI experts in the world. This well-developed course by him would benefit anyone who wants to see what happens under the hood in many machine learning applications. He taught that ML should be applied as an art and not by blindly applying the brute force of modern computational power. ,5
2517,"Thank you Andrew for your guidance and support all along this course. It was really fun and interesting to take this course. I learned a lot as I used this course to transition into the field of Machine Learning and AI. I hope more such courses are made available on this wonderful platform, Coursera thus helping and enabling thousands of students and young professionals to improve their career. Thank you !!",5

2519,"Super course, challenging at times but very worth the effort to complete. Andrew has a very good style of lecturing and his course was well structured.  The coursera delivery system (especially the reminders!) also worked well to keep me on track to finish. It was a good mix of theory and practice and I did learn much and it will be a great help to me for my work in the area of Machine Learning.  Well done,",5
2520,Thank you Prof. Ng. It was a well thought out collection of machine learning tools introduced at conceptual level.  The exercises were relevant to practical applications. I also liked the sections where  watch outs and advice in implementing machine learning tools are discussed. The exercises had the code which takes care of the data processing and that helps to focus on writing the code only for the tools. ,5
2521,"I took the course because of my curiosity about neural networks. The section about neural networks was not sufficient to satisfy this curiosity, but the course as a whole opened many doors in my mind as to the applications of data analysis and numerical computation. This so far exceeded my expectations that the course deserved five stars. I will continue studying until I feel I have mastered neural networks",5
2522,"I feel totally equipped to use the things I've learned in this class, and prepared to start diving deeper into the field of machine learning, after taking this course. It really covers the fundamentals, including everything you need to get off the ground, in a way that is both accessible to new-comers, and refreshing to someone with minor experience in the field. Andrew Ng is a gem and his course is a gift.",5
2523,"Honestly, Andrew N.G might be one of the best tutors out there. I had so much fun learning during this course, and the way he explains the concepts through the presentations just makes this best way to learn any course. I am ready to apply all the things that I have learned here to apply out in the real world and who knows it might be of any help to someone. Thank you Coursera for this wonderful experience.",5
2524,"The assignments were very well designed. Andrew Ng has a practical way of explaining things and a delightfully subtle sense of humour. The videos were engaging (I preferred to watch them at 1.25x or 1.5x speed and am glad there was the option to do so). I did not use the forums much, as the material was not very new to me, but it looked like they were very active. Thank you to everybody running this course!",5
2525,"Very good! I liked the way Andrew Ng is explaining the concepts in the videos. Quite a lot of programming (the duration is under estimated I think) but the canevas is prepared so the student can focus on the very point of the course. It is not too complicated in terms of mathematics and, when it could be, it is made easier by an explaination. Thank you to the other professors and helpers on the forums too !",5
2526,Really great course. I took it because the same course at my university was much more theoretical and I wanted to see a more practical approach. Andrew Ng was able to combine backgroud knowledge with algortihm details and useful real world advice and has created a great intorduction for machine learning beginners. I can only recommend this course to everyone interested. Thanks you very much for your effort. ,5
2527,Très bon cours qui met bien en place les différents algorithmes utilisés pour le Machine Learning,5

The Q & A boards more than answered the questions I had with the programming assignments.,5
2537,,5
2538,"Really great course, It covers most of the ML algorithms and the teacher is super clear and schematic. As for the programming exercises, personally, I used Matlab, and the exercises are incredibly useful and straightforward to be understood and implemented. For more, the community is really broad, and it is possible to share many info and material with others which may help in the hard topic in teh class.",5
2539,"This is a great introduction to machine learning. The assignments are fun and challenging although they are in Matlab/Octave which I find not as useful as Python. Even though this course was recorded years ago, I still find the content amazingly relevant to today's ML problems. Thank you everyone who puts effort into making this online class possible and who continues to answer discussion/forum questions!",5
2540,"The class was refreshing and fun at the same time.During this pandemic , my ""learning Curve"" was steadily decreasing but through this course ,I now have knowledge to comprehend a real world problem and tools to design an appropriate solution for the same.I am really grateful to Dr Andrew N G for creating a platform which helps people in not only gaining knowledge but also the power to decide their future. ",5

I've encountered problems over the years which I now know how to solve. Highly recommended class! ",5
2543,"Andrew Ng is a gifted teacher who knows how to balance background, examples, theory, and practice. Though I've been working in this field as it grew up around me, I was looking for a course that would teach the fundamentals, and I was not disappointed. This was exactly what I wanted and needed, and I'd enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who wants to augment their experience with deeper understanding.",5
2544,"It takes a long time to complete the course, but it is really worthwhile. The questions of ""what are the tools for machine learning"" and ""how to use those tools"" are answered clearly throughout the course. The programming exercises are also very detailed and informative, giving huge convenience and benefits for beginners. I hope to apply the knowledge I gained from the course to help others in the future.",5
2545,Thanks a lot for that great course! The content is structured explained very well. It was fun to participate and I would highly recommend it to friends and colleges. The only wish I have is: I would love to see some proof (as an extension-video perhabs) or some more 'transfer'-exercise (I think most questions already directly answered in the videos). Thank you very much again. I really enjoyed the course!,5
2546,A very good course for machine learning enthusiastics to start with. Review questions and programming exercises are well designed to help recap the concepts and how to apply machine learning concepts in real.

Thank you very much for preparing this course!",5
2595,"Excellent! Magnificently done! As a mathematician, I can appreciate trying to avoid using too much math to explain things (since most are not exactly fans of math), but I thought it was a very good amount. That, combined with the great explanations, visuals, made things very clear to me in small amounts of time!",5
2596,Very happy I took this class. It was more as a hobby pursuit to learn more about things that I have long had an interest in (I am not a professional programmer). I'm excited to take the next steps in programming projects to implement some of what I've learned in my personal side projects. ,5
2597,"The teacher explains very well the topics, he gives all the necessary tools to understand the ideas behind many machine learning implementations, without spending too much time on mathematical details. He gives many practical suggestions on actual applications. I found this course very complete and not too much complex, therefore I highly recommned it for anyone who want to understand machine learning",5
2598,This is an excellent course. Andrew Ng has explained the concepts pretty well and his arguments have been persuasive. This course is a must-start milestone for someone wanting to venture on the path of Machine learning or Deep learning. The only downside I found was the assignments were to be practised in Matlab/ Octave instead of python. Otherwise this is an excellent course. Thank you Dr. Andrew Ng.,5
2599,It is an absolutely delight to go through the course. This has been designed in such lucid way that anyone can develop and interest to delve further into the subject matter. I loved completing the course and happy that I made a right decision to invest my time and money into this. Thanks to Andrew Ng and his team for the course product. Also thanks to my friends who suggested me ML course on Coursera.,5

Thank you also for the rigorous review questions and structured programming exercises. It helped a lot in strengthening the knowledge in the videos by actually doing the exercises.",5
2617,The course is a great introduction to Machine Learning. It is extremely pragmatic in that the course was highly aimed at giving you the practical skills to actually apply machine learning to real problems. It wasn't overly heavy on explaining a lot of the mathematical theory underlying the subject but I think that would probably doubled the length of the course anyway. Overall would highly recommend. ,5
2618,Andrew sir is one of the most influential persons in the field of machine learning and AI,5
2619,"I did really enjoy with the way Andrew Ng goes through the topics of the ML and simply explains some of the complicated looking methods. Assignments were specifically very valuable in terms of practicing the topics and programming skills even though, for me as a person almost with zero programing skills, some of the assignments took very long hours to pass. Very good class that motivates to start Dee",5
2620,"The course was absolutely great for getting started! Apart from all the good things that have already been said, I would like to give feedback for adding additional videos. It would be great to have videos about newer techniques like Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, LGM, etc. so that learners can implement them in Competitons and Hackathons. Thanks again for this course and the financial aid.",5
2621,"Super awesome. I have tried many online courses on ML and this is by far the best I found online. Intuitions are done very well, every topic is taught brilliantly by Andrew. I am glad that I found this course. I have also tried courses of Krill Eremenko and Lazy Programmer, and those are not even near to this. And many times these courses taught you wrong things. I just bought deeplearning.ai course.",5
2622,"Amazing class! This was my first course both on Coursera and on the topic of Machine Learning, so I do not have much to compare to. However I found this class very enjoyable. The material is designed to meet many different skill levels, so if you are unsure if you are ready for this material, or if you are looking for more of a challenge, this course is perfect for you.",5
2623,"Andrew Ng teaches a great Machine Learning course.  Ng speaks clearly and the flow of the class is easy to follow.  The examples made things clear and the homework exercises really cemented the learning points.  Overall, the class was just the right amount of challenge and fun.  I now have a solid understanding and intuition about Machine Learning and will use what I've learned.  Thank you Andrew Ng! ",5
2624,"The course was excellent, but I have to say that the exercises are a bit boring because all we have to do is code the same things again and again, instead of practicing different aspects of machine learning. This is only my humble opinion, and for a great course like this we can demand a little more. This course put the rod very high to the other courses. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us.",5
2625,"This course teaches the fundamentals of various machine learning algorithms. Andrew's teaching/coaching style is excellent as he explains even the hardest concepts in simple ways that everyone can understand. If you go through his class videos twice the subject materials will be very clear and you can pass the quiz easily. After taking this course, I am motivated to learn more about machine learning.",5
2626,"I've been a beginner in the field of applied machine learning and have already worked on some projects, but this course has helped me to get a better incite, a better grasp of the associated topics with machine learning. Ng has been a great instructor, the way he develops the intuition is unmatched and maybe that's why this course has opened new gates for the people including me. Thank you soo much.",5
2627,"The best online course I've taken by far! After several weeks of going through videos, quizzes and programming assignments, I learnt a lot of concepts and good practices for applying Machine Learning. At this point, I feel better prepared to study more challenging books about ML and take part in ML projects. Thank you, Andrew Ng, for showing me the beauty of this challenging but valuable discipline. ",5
2628,One fine day I would love to meet Andrew sir personally or might even work under him!,5
2629,Amazing course. I enjoyed this course following the instructions and videos. I certainly know machine learning and i am ready to apply these techniques to my current projects.,5
2630," it was a fantastic course. Although I work in corporate now and it is not directly related to my field. I decided to take this class up. I was not sure if I would finish this, but Andrew ensured that I move one video at a time. I was rusty with coding, but the simplicity of teaching enabled me to complete the programming assignments as well. Thanks Andrew. Next course - AI specialization (Hopefully)",5
2631,"I just loved this course. One of the most well organized courses I have done. Everything about this course is perfect. The lectures, materials. Professor Andrew Ng is a great. In this course I have learned two most important things. One is how to teach machines and another one is how to teach humans. And Professor Andrew Ng taught me those two. Again great course for any machine learning enthusiast.",5
2632,"This course is perfect. It is all well explained, sometimes two times in different wordings, and the material becomes very clear in this way. The exercises are sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, and you get good guiding. Also quizzes are interesting. PDF slides make the course complete.",5
2633,"Thank you so much for putting all this together. It's been a privilege to be able to learn such a complex and high rated topic from a true master. The course is very well organized and accessible, even for someone as me, without previous knowledge in machine learning, math, algebra and other matters.",5
2634,The course is very well organized covering a lot of topics. The assignments are mapped well with the course content and help to understand the system development well. Professor ANg is very clear in his explanations and makes you feel very comfortable even with the difficult concepts. ,5
2635,Outstanding course. ,5
2636,The course has really helped gaining practical and applicable knowledge in Machine Learning algorithms. I particularly appreciate the course delivery by Prof. Andrew Ng where not only he takes us through the algorithm but also help build the intuition of the methodology for us to customize the algoriths as well for our specific problems. Thanks so much professor Andrew Ng for sharing your knowledge!,5
2637,"What an amazing 2-month journey it has been to refresh and strengthen my knowledge in Machine Learning in my spare time with this course provided by the Stanford University.Such a wonderful and well-structured course with real-life programming tasks such as implementing hand-written digits recognition, image compression, building a spam-filter, detecting anomalies, building recommender systems etc.  ",5
2638,"Such a wonderful course. Andrew really takes us from ""Zero to Hero"" here. From absolutely no knowledge about ML, I have reached the point where I feel a lot confident about what I know, but there's still a very very long way to go. The video lectures are very clear, the reading material lucid, and the assignments and quizzes interesting. Thank you Andrew, thank you Stanford, and thank you Coursera.",5
2639,One of the best courses I have studied till now. I really appreciate the way Dr. Andrew Ng teaches this course and explains the detailed concepts related to machine learning. The course structure is amazing and anyone who wants to get an enhanced insight in the field of Machine learning must take up this course. The programming exercises are pretty intuitive and the best part of the course as well. ,5
2640,"Great preparation of a complex topic, explained in 'easy' words, providing good examples and lead the learner from theory by asking questions (review during the videos), over Quizzes at the end of a section/week to getting into practice and thus getting confronted with the need of applying what has been shown/educated. I really appreciate the friendly, motivating behavior and guidance of Andrew Ng.",5
2641,"Thank you Andrew! Great explanation and easy to understand. I have spent the past one year to read through several machine learning reference books but none of them are able to help me to achieve the effectiveness as taking this course. Special thanks for your dedication and effort to help more people. I hope that with the acquired knowledge over here, I can work on something special in the future.",5
2642,"I really enjoyed this class.  Professor Ng clearly put a lot of time into preparing material for this course.  You really get a lot out of it for the time you put into it!  I do some machine learning work, but had never taken a class in the basics.  Feel like this was a great opportunity to fill in the missing gaps in my knowledge - would highly recommend if you find yourself in a similar position. ",5
2643,"Thanks Andrew and teams behind for making such a wonderful course of machine learning. The way how Andrew teach really help me to understand some complicated concepts of the machine learning and the programming assignments really help me to have a better understanding of what the algorithm work. Though I still have lots of things that I need to learn about machine learning, I get a good start here.",5
2644,"This is in depth, amazing instruction on Machine Learning. I was quiet new to topic and learned a lot through Ng's instructions and lengthy assignments. I know there are more topics into this field but this is a great staring point. I would like to thank Andrew Ng for his great teaching ability, all the mentors for answering the questions, and of course Coursera for providing the platform for this.",5
2645,"As a teacher who understands the nuances of the subject and who also realizes the challenges that a novice encounters in this field, Andrew Ng has done a terrific job in teaching this course in a comprehensive manner. The course contents are interesting and challenging , and the quizzes and programming assignments are engaging enough to help you learn Machine Learning in a fun and practical manner.",5
2646,Andrew is really good at starting from the basics and gradually adding depth.,5
2647,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course! the initial assignments on Neural Networks were slightly tough but as I moved on to the unsupervised learning, they became much easier. This course was very well taught, very informative and its commendable how Andrew sir has explained each algorithm in such detail and given many techniques to evaluate the algorithms and make their implementations highly efficient. ",5
2648,"Prof. Ng is an excellent communicator.  The material is well organized, and the quizzes and assignments focus on highlighting solving the problems at hand, while avoiding difficult extraneous challenges that might otherwise decrease motivation.  After completing this course, my motivation to pursue and apply ML is significantly higher than when I began.  Thanks Professor Ng and the team of Mentors!",5
2649,"This is an excellent course. It covers many aspects of machine learning and it goes fairly deep in each aspect. The assignments are tough but not too tough.  All in all I found it was more than worth of my time and I came out very knowledgeable about machine learning. The only suggestion that I have is that after clearing a quiz, it should tell the mistakes as well.",5
2650,"A fantastic introduction to machine learning and its applications, covering a real breadth of subject areas. Andrew Ng's teaching method is very accessible, enabling you to grasp the concepts without getting too bogged down in the mathematical detail. The programming exercises were challenging, especially in the early stages, but did get easier as you became more familiar with coding the equations. ",5
2651,"Honestly, this was such a great course. 11 weeks ago I knew very little about machine learning ( mostly just buzz words like neural networks, deep learning and so no). Andrew was a very good teacher, taking time to explain fundamentals of linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, case studies and more. It takes time to complete it, but it's a time spent well.",5
2652,This was a very good course. Actually one of the best that I completed. Lectures and programming assignments were very interesting challenges to me. Additional materials were helpfull. Thank You for your efforts to share material of this course in such a professional and well organized way. I hope to see more courses like this one. I recommend this course to everyone interested in machine learning.,5
2653,"It was a wonderful course and I do not know how I learned these difficult topics so easily and I enjoyed every moment of it. All the exercises are designed in such a way that the topics of the course are fully understood, and I can really say that no one can present this lesson better than Dr. Andrew Ng. I really appreciate the opportunity that is given to all students around the world. thank you.",5
2654,"Excellent course.Even though it looks and feels tough, but it teaches you the concepts in a way that you can visual and interpret how the things are actually working under the hood. It definitely helps you decide your next course of action in learning machine learning. Thank you so much to Andrew Ng for de cluttering the machine learning path and providing insight into this amazing field of study.",5
2655,"As a beginner learning ML for the first time, I find the course covers essentials topics to start exploring ML. Completing this course by no means make me a ML expert but it definitely introduced a new way of thinking which helps me greatly in solving problems. Whether or not you are going to working in ML, you can generally apply such thinking in your field of work after this course. Recommended.",5
2656,"it is a very good  online course of machine learning,  it fits for some one who wants to go into machine learning field and learns how machine learning is, how to use it in real engine problem. I get more basic knowledge of machine learning from this course and I gradually have a clear route to get further study.Thanks for Andre Ng and everyone who works at background of this community, thank you. ",5
2657,"Very well explained, also the mistakes and errors are already corrected and there is a section to check them. It is frustrating sometimes to see how many errors of concept you have (when you do the quiz) but once you understand the correct concept, you pass. I can feel me proud of it. So thank you again. My favorite and most emotive week It was the last one. Thank you again for so beautiful words. ",5
2658,Thank you so much Prof. Andrew Ng. I wish I could thank you even more in person. Thank you all the mentors for your helpful comments. Thank you everyone remotely related to the success of the course. I really enjoyed completing it. I might have to see it again even though it was made easy to understand but to keep everything on tips will require practice and revisiting topics. Please keep it free!,5
2659,The course teaches a variety of algorithms for both-supervised and unsupervised learning. ,5
2660,"Thank you for this course. I found it very helpful and really got a lot out of it.  I really value the time and effort you, dear instructor, put in preparing this course material. I just have a very small note : concerning the complex proofs that you sometimes skip, it would be very helpful if you just leave a link for that for those interested in taking a look at the proof.",5
2661,"Professor Ng shared quite a lot in his experience of ML system design, which is really useful. Also this is the first ever course I finished on coursera. Some quiz questions are not so interesting as focus on a little bit too few on math or very basic math. The programming question are well developed, so it is easy to navigate around. I really need to say thank you professor and the coursera team!",5
2662,"Excellent course, this is the first MOOC course I have ever started taking. I appreciated the organization of the content that Andrew Ng put together, especially the programming assignment that helped me in a significant way to improve my understanding to the content, to spot out my misunderstandings, and to leave me with a good source codes for the future applications of machine learnings easily.",5
2663,"This was a pretty great course. With a focus on understanding and coding regression algorithms, I was engaged throughout the course. I'm a programmer with a physics B.Sc trying to make a shift away from product development and in to analytical problem solving. I found the lectures useful, the wiki useful when I didn't have time to watch the lectures, and the quizzes and assignments very practical.",5
2664,"I had a basic understanding of some ML tools before entering into this course, but being taught by a teacher with deep understanding of both pros and cons of algos, basic math behind it, has lent me a whole different aspect in which I will now see my professional ML problems. Hearty thanks to Prof. Ng. And Sir, am pretty sure your ppt notes are going to help me for as long as I stay in the field!",5
2665,"I been taking many machine learning and data science courses from different sources, as it's one of my hobbies exporting data and see what's going on aside of my main work.",5
2666,This is a really usefull crash course for those that are willing to set foot in the Machine Learning field. It provides a lot of interesting theoretical and practical examples through programming exercises that are really well documented.,5
2667,An excellent course covering many aspects of machine learning. I was that glad I have a fairly strong mathematical background as that enabled me to follow the equations and mathematics. I imagine this may have been off putting for others. I am really looking forward to getting a chance to apply some of the techniques to real life problems. I will likely revisit the slides and lectures many times. ,5
2668,Amazing course that gives you a good understanding of how to apply machine learning.  My only criticism is that some of the explanations were too complex and the assignments were around writing the algorithms as supposed to implementing them.  ,5
2669,"I can't mention how much staff teach me this course.  And this course motivated me to start read math books and learn math. I was always running away from math problems, but now I can understand allot of difficult math equations, hypothesis. I have started to love math. Big thank you to your hard work which you putted to make this course real and thank you for knowledge which you share with us :)",5
2670,"El curso provee TODO el material necesario para entender los conceptos. Me encantaron especialmente los ejercicios de programación, donde se pone en práctica y se ve funcionando todo lo visto en clase.",5
2671,"Great Course. Can gain the essential insights in the field of machine learning and lay a great foundation for more sophisticated topics in this area such as deep learning. Professor Ng shares each concept step by step in a really considerate way. It's a very enjoyable experience for me. Before this course, I have no coding experience at all. It is good for beginners and opens a new window for me.",5
2672,"This is definitely the Bible, or the Bhagwat Gita for Machine Learning. Prof. Andrew explains everything in very fine detail so that even persons having a non computer-science or a non-calculus background would be able to understand the concepts quite well. The Mentor(s), especially Tom has been really helpful in providing inputs to queries as well as on the programming assignments in the forums.",5
2673,I got a good foundation on Machine Learning on which I hope to build. The course is well paced and structured and the weekly deadlines for the assignments have been useful to drive me to keep up and get my assignments done. The one thing I would change is add programming assignments for the last couple of weeks - it is somehow unsatisfying to go through the videos but not practice those concepts.,5
2674,"Probably the best course i took so far at Coursera. Professor Andrew explains everythin in a way anyone can understand and he focus on what's really important. Besides, the hands-on projects are very valuable, giving us the opportunity to better understand the concepts shown in class. And it's also so cool the way we deliver the Matlab/Octave assignments.",5
2675,"The short video format allows to make progress every day. I completed my studies a few decades ago and was anxious about the required algebra and programming levels, but I decided to try and see how far I could get. The course is focusing on intuitions first before going a bit deeper in the maths, which I found very helpful. Yes the course might be a bit dated now, but it is a great intro to ML. ",5
2676,"I'm a working R&D physicist at a US Department of Energy laboratory, and I found this course extremely useful to understand the basics of machine learning. Honestly, in my opinion, previous to taking this class, the topic was shrouded in mystery. I feel that many of the core concepts have been clearly taught. I can now use the material for my research to make discoveries/development in my field. ",5
2677,"this type of education encourages students like me to learn complex and advanced things like machine learning after a huge gap of learning of about 13 years. i really appreciate andrew ng, stanford and all those working on educating  the world with open sourcing. i really thank you guys heartedly. and i think we need to spread awareness about E-Learning and especially in coursera. thank you.....",5
2678,"It was a very good class in the sense that it had balanced amount of mathematics and programming. I initially thought not using Python as the programming language was a big minus for the class, but if it adopted Python, I think many of the coding would be covered by just importing ready-made classes and programs, that the students will not learn much of what's behind methods of machine learning. ",5
2679,This is a must course for someone who is looking forward to master machine learning.,5
2680,"The course goes from ups and downs in terms of complexity and time needed to complete. There is a switch from math to intuition towards the end. I rated the course as 5 stars, because it deserves it. This is not to say about editing/production of the material. Be prepared to skip through unedited takes here and there as obviously whoever edited the videos did not proof-read them start to finish.",5
2681,"Brilliant course, love the mix of theory and practice.",5
2682,"A great course to learn fundamentals of machine learning and also the tools to apply these techniques in building practical solutions. The lectures were well paced and clear, the Quiz and programming assignments helped a lot on expanding further on the lectures. Overall this is a really good course for anyone who wants to start a career in machine learning or even refresh the fundamentals alike. ",5
2683,"Great course for understanding how machine learning algorithms work, I did some other course before this one and it was more on a higher level, talking about algorithms which are already implemented in library and showing how to use them, but this course gave me more insight on how they actually work, which is really useful and interesting. Great material and interesting tasks, not too difficult",5
2684,"After working on this course for almost three months now, listening to Andrew Ng´s final words, I actually feel quite touched. Was a fun course to take . Hearing such a brilliant mind explaining it in such a good, entertaining  and interesting though humble way EVEN tanking me for my time and effort felt just great. Thank you Professor! Thank you Coursera! And thank you Tom Mosher(Tutorials!!!)! ",5
2685,"This course is one of the best Data Science courses available online. This has taught me advanced Data Science Machine Learning terminologies and algorithms. The hands-on exercises are helpful in applying the concepts learned in the course using MATLAB/Octave, which is really helpful. Overall, a wonderful experience to be a part of course offered by the very intuitive and intelligent, Andrew Ng. ",5
2686,"I absolutely loved this MOOC. The best one I've taken by far. It is so instructive to get immediate feedback on your code/work. I can't recommend this course enough. If you want to gain a solid grasp of machine learning, and even learn to implement the algorithms yourself, you must take this course. Not only is Prof. Ng amazing, but the course staff replies quickly and respectfully. I want more!",5
2687,"Dr. Ng is a conceptual teacher, gifted with the ability to convey concepts and directions in the course that provides pragmatic topical coverage with sufficient depth. I thoroughly enjoyed completing the course, and I hope he will find the time in the future to design and teach a course with more in-depth teachings in machine learning and statistics as well - which I will look forward to taking. ",5
2688,This is an excellent course! It is the second time I take this course and it is getting better with each session. The material is explained very clearly and the concepts are easy to understand. The exercises are challenging and really make you think. All the necessary programs are provided and all you need is the will to learn.,5
2689,"This is a fun class and I learned a lot about machine learning.  Professor Andrew Ng did a very good job on teaching complex concepts in an easy understanding manner. All materials are presented very clearly along with helpful examples and fun exercises. With the online video, I can replay any time I want when in question. This is one of the best class I have ever had and I highly recommend it.",5
2690,"Dr. Ng does an excellent job of bridging fundamentals with applied concepts to provide a strong insight into how to implement and address machine learning problems in the real world. The programming assignments are a good way to improve understanding of the algorithms, but by far the most applicable element of the course is the concepts of bias/variance tradeoff, regularization, and evaluation.",5
2691,"This class has deepened my understanding of machine learning and helped me to get systematic understanding of algorithms, which beforehand I learnt in quite a chaotic manner. Andrew Ng is an great lecturer, explaining everything in great detail and with great care. Course takes a lot of time to teach not only the algorithms, but the intuition of applying them. It was a pleasure and a great fun!",5
2692,"This course is easily the best foundational course on Machine Learning. It builds on complex topics incrementally in a form that is easy for beginners (like me) grasp the concepts easily. It took me some time to complete the course, but it has now provided me the tools necessarily to pursue further learning on ML and build real world applications. Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng.You are a rockstar :) ",5
2693,"I am a PhD student in communications engineering. My research interest is intelligent communication systems. I started learning machine learning to be able to carry out my research. Based on many other online courses, I can say this course is the best so far in terms of teaching, exercises and hands on problem solving. I highly recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn machine learning.",5
2694,"I loved this course it is perfect  to understand machine learning. Andrew Ng is the best teacher i have got in this course, he has very good knowledge of ML,AI and he explains each and every concept in very detail and in very simple and easy manner. This course is designed in such a good manner that it covers the theory knowledge of machine learning and give full insight of practical knowledge.",5
2695,"This is a great course to start the ""Machine Learning"" journey. The course material is well planned, well timed. Things becomes more clear when you yourself experience it, and that is what the programming assignments does, you will start visualizing the concepts thought in the theory classes. Special mention about Prof. Andrew for his simplistic way of explaining complex things. Thank You Sir!!",5

2721,Thanks a lot to the team for having done an immense amount of work creating this course and the programming exercises!,5
2722,"It's been really fortunate to have been taught by Prof. AndrewNg. He not only simplifies the concepts very well but also guides how to efficiently implement machine learning to various applications. Also, programming exercises were not really difficult or time-consuming but the course was well planned and proper guidance was available at each step through discussion forums and lecture videos. ",5
2723,"Fantastic delivery, very succinct and yet potently delivered. Excellent level of rigor (not too rigorous but still enough to make you appreciate the theory). Prof Ng makes you feel at ease. The programming exercises were EXCELLENT. They truly made the difference for me, between something that could have been abstract, to something that actually seems practically relevant. Thank you very much.",5
2724,"This is one of the most usefull courses I've ever followed. I was in a 'data mining' team for more than 7 years, made many reviews, even developed a model - from scratch, but with the guidance of very detailed programs written by a collegue. I've learned things 'on the job'. This is the course I should have followed after maybe one year in the team, to understand... Thank you for this course!",5
2725,"Extraordinary teaching and wonderful programming exercises. Just a couple of weeks back, I did not have any idea of machine learning and now I have a sense of what it is all about. The course gave a wonderful introduction to many problems in machine learning in a less mathematical and more practical way. I thank Coursera and Prof. Andrew Ng for making such a nice course available on internet. ",5
2726,"This course gives a very understandable introduction to machine learning - the algorithms, the concepts, best practices and so on. The exercices are all in Matlab, which is maybe not the most used programming language in the real world, but it certainly makes thinking about vectorisation much more straightforward. The teaching style of prof. Ng makes this course quite pleasant to sit through.",5
2727,Excellent course for anyone that wants to learn the field of Machine Learning.  Dr Andrew Ng is a great teacher.  His way of explaining difficult concepts was superb.  I really liked how he spent time giving insights and intuition of the algorithms.  I didn't know much about ML before starting the class and came out developing a good appreciation for the filed.  Thank you Dr Ng and Coursera!! ,5
2728,"I can't be thankful enough to Dr. Andrew Ng and all of the others that put their effort and time to make this course so wonderful. I've learnt a lot from this class and it isn't possible for me to put all the gratitude that I have into words.

2733,"The instructor gave clear explanations of the model introduced in this class. The programming exercises were somewhat easier than I thought and most of difficult parts were already provided to the learners. However, they are good for somewhat entry level practices. It would be good to see more advanced follow-up on this class and real-world application of the various machine learning models. ",5
2734,"I thought the class was structured very well with the videos, quizzes and programming assignments.  I learned a great deal about machine learning, a subject I had no previous knowledge of.  Professor Ng did an excellent job teaching the various machine learning concepts and relating them to real world examples.  I really enjoyed the class and look forward to implementing the tools I learned.",5
2735,"This course is a very good course, it made me have more understanding of machine learning and gave me some idea how to perform the algorithm.  The lecture provide very good explanation and the learning system is very good. After I finished this course would like to know about it and improve my own algorithm .Thank you for lecturer and team for providing very good and very interesting course.",5
2736,Really enjoyed Andrew's teaching style.,5
2737,  I've started this course in my first semester but it was too early for me. Now I completed it in my fourth semester as the mathematics required is of my current level. Indeed this is the first and most important course for machine learning fundamentals of all time for me! I would like to thank Andrew NG who covers every topic in detail and to coursera for providing this platform of learning.  ,5
2738,"This course bring me a solid background about many algorithm working for machine learning. As a student of Data Science major, now I have to use some optimization package for Python to implement my first group project. Without the knowledge from this course, it may take me a long time to fully understand the mechanism behind each provided tool. Once again, thank you so much, Prof. Andrew Ng!",5
2739,This is a great course. Prof. Andrew Ng can explain tons of algorithms that are widely used in Machine Learning very concisely and clearly in a relatively short of time. The programming assignment is interesting and useful. There are lots of real world applications where ML algorithm can really be applied to. This is my first online course and I would recommend it to anyone interested in ML.,5
2740, Amazing Lectures by Andrew N.,5
2741,"Best class I ever took, lots of useful and straight to the point knowledge without overlooking the elementary stuff and maths.

Thanks to Andrew for beautiful intuition and logic  ",5
2744,This course offers the right amount of stat/math/theory background; personally I believe this is perfectly balanced with just the right level of practical foundation.,5
2745,"It was a lot more work than expected, especially alongside a full-time job, but the course kept getting more and more interesting. This high quality content combined with as great of a teacher as Andrew is makes for a very compelling learning experience. I'm immensely grateful to him and the Coursera team for providing such a high class education for free. Thank you very much and keep it up!",5
2746,"This course is a great way to begin studying machine learning, and developing intuition. I tried it a couple of years ago, with my background somewhat lacking. At the time I could follow everything, but I gave up eventually. Now coming with a little more mathematical maturity and software development knowledge, this isn't hard, and it is simply the perfect gateway drug to an amazing world :)",5
2747,"Great course!  Main points I found useful:1. Actually implementing the cost functions and gradients in MATLAB really made the formulae sink in.2. Bias-variance trade off: plot the learning curve of train & CV error vs number of samples to determine whether you have a low bias algo. If not, going 'big data' won't help.3. Ceiling analysis to figure out which areas to spend effort on improving.",5
2748,"Very clear ideas and structures, even as a student who have learnt other machine learning course, it is still worthy of learning the course. The course gives a view of the algebra and the programming exercise are not only for practice but also help us to better understand the course material, such as PCA's image example, which reduces data detention then recovers the data back. Good course!",5
2749,"Appreciate the time and effort that Andrew Ng put into creating a course that allows those interested in machine learning to have the opportunity to learn about many different algorithms and processes in the field and the potential applications of using, troubleshooting, or simply being able to more prudently identify which machine learning pillar (supervised, unsupervised, etc.) to choose.",5
2750,"This has been one of the best learning experiences I have been through. The instructor's style is simple yet strong to build on complex ideas and communicate them in an understandable manner. The programming exercises , while challenging in the beginning, are a joy to complete. Anybody who wants to know how ML works or wants to build a career in ML should take this as a foundational course.",5
2751,"Great introduction to machine learning. Lectures clearly explain concepts and Professor Ng is great at explaining the ""why"" behind things. The lecture slides are also really helpful.",5
2752,"Amazing course! Professor Ng is a fantastic teacher who explains everything very clearly. The questions and programming excerises were just the right level of difficulty, challenging the student to understand the concepts without spending too much time programming everything yourself. One suggestion for improvement: the English subtitles were quite often incorrect, which could be confusing.",5
2753,  There are many few people like Andrew Ng who can teach a complex thing like Machine Learning in a simple way. It was a wonderful learning experience for me and I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Machine Learning. No prior programming experience required to take this course. Just need to know the basic if else and loops will be more than enough for taking this course.,5
2754,"Really phenomenal course! I'm currently at week 3 and have just completed my first assignment. Everything is done to an incredibly high standard. The first assignment was very well made, better quality than any assignment I have had in my 5 years at UK universities. Once I'm finished with this one I'm going to start on the Deep Learning course, apparently that is also to a similar standard. ",5
2755,"A very helpful course. Learnt a lot from this course. The discussion forum was very helpful. The course was broken down into simple lectures and very easy to understand.

I was already aware of some of these algorithms before the course but only had a high level understanding. The explanations in the videos are excellent and I really enjoyed completing the programming exercises. ,5
2758,"Very useful course for understanding the machine learning backgrounds behind the popular available tools, and for applying algorithms to more complex solutions. Math and MATLAB/Octave reviews help me be familiar to learn Python, numpy, pandas, matlabplot, jupyter, and so on. I've got more confidence and effort to listen to the lectures after the end of the academy lifestyle in last decade.",5
2759,"Great class, great teacher, and great tutors! I liked everything about this course: the content is clear, the programming exercises help better understanding and strengthening the concepts described in the video.

Technical details are also provided throughout the course making its very interesting and keeping you away from getting lost along the track. ",5
2770,"This course is rated pretty well for it's technical content and way of delivering intuition, but Professor Andrew Ng does more than that ,from offering insights on practical cases, potential shortcomings, advice, applications, et cetera, proving the very first statement he made at the start of the course. Having taken up this course, this really defines how good actual education can be.  ",5
2771,"For someone whose academic background is ca. 30 years ago, this was a great journey into data science with the right level of detail to understand the concepts, the right mix of practical exercises to further deepen the learning content and last but not least a very enjoyable set of small video lectures by Andrew Ng that explained the complex material in an easy to consume way.  Thank You!",5
2772,"Outstanding teacher with valuable experience pushes this course to it's limits.  Although it might be a good idea to have some knowledge in fields like linear algebra or calculus, instructor does perfect job minimizing the required knowledge as much as possible (without turning this course into a pure math class). To conclude - this seems to be perfect intro course to the machine learning.",5

I highly enjoyed Andrew's voice and manner of speaking, it was very calming and reassuring. He made difficult concepts sound easy and comprehensible. Also his passion about the subject is touching. Overall, I enjoyed everything about this course. ",5
2775,"The course is fantastic and Andrew is a phenomenal teacher.  Of course, you don't need me to tell you that.  There were IMO a number of technical issues particularly with the tests and programming assignments - really, they ought to work with Octave 4.0 among other things.  However these issues were not significant enough for me to detract a star.",5
2776,"Thank you professor Andrew Ng for taking the time to teach such a complex topic. You do a great job in simplifying the theory and narrowing down the cues that are important which helps us to prioritize our learning. I am in the process of changing my career and this course has serve as a staple for this change. My journey just started so there is still much to learn and work. Thanks, Luis",5
2777,"This was really great course. It wasn't easy to pass but in the end it worth every hour spent. My goal was to pass every quiz and assignment with score 100%. So for that reason I had to try some quizzes and assignments couple of times, but this repetition allowed me to go even deeper into the topic and explore deeper, and ultimately gain additional valuable knowledge. Thank you very much. ",5

Octave helps in bridging concept, mathematics & Programming. The standout thing for me was to relate all the theory into practical/Industrial application. Thank you very much for simplifying such complicated topic.",5
2796,Andrew NG is an amazing teacher. He is very humble and makes complicated concepts accessible. I almost feel a touch of sadness that this part of the learning journey has come to an end. I'd definitely recommend this course to everyone interested in learning about the different LM algorithms. The discussions on forums provide great support when/if you get stuck on programming assignments. ,5
2797,I wanted to learn basics of ML and I feel immensely good about finishing the course along with the assignments and quizes. The teaching by Andrew Ng is in such simple lucid language that I hardly had few doubts in between the course time.  Explanation of how to do each assignment was also precise enough. I would highly recommend students/professionals/teachers etc to take up this course. ,5
2798,"This course has opened up multiple paths of progression for me, as I can now get involved in Deep Learning and other cutting edge technologies. I highly recommend this course for all people who are interested in getting their hands dirty with AI or ML. Though it is an introductory course, it leaves you with a lot of knowledge and insights on applying that knowledge in real life. 5 stars!",5
2799,The videos are easy to follow and start from a relatively easy level.,5
2800,"Excellent course that helps you onboard machine learning! This course provides plenty of examples to strengthen the understanding of principles. The structure of the course is also well organized so that the you can deep dive into each specific area while keep seeing the big picture. Moreover, Matlab programming exercises are super beneficial to digest and integrate what you have learnt. ",5
2801,"The best course I have taken on Coursera so far. Every video, quiz, and assignment was thoughtfully produced and selected for the class. All the supplemental material and support from the discussion forums was ample enough for me to work my way through the course with minimal headaches and maximum knowledge gain. Thank you to Professor Ng and everyone else who helped develop this course!",5
2802,"This course sparked my curiosity over machine learning, to some extent I do not get tired of watching the videos of Andrew Ng whose teaching technique is significantly unique that he can simplify the most complex subjects into simpler ones without missing the essence of the subject. I wonder whether there is any follow up course as I feel that I have become addicted to learn from him :-)",5
2803,"I am in so much love with machine learning after taking this course. The way Sir Andrew teaches is very calm and understandable, also by doing the assignments we get a feel of how to do things by ourselves. This course has taught me a lot and made me really confident about machine learning and I can't thank Sir Andrew enough for this. I absolutely loved this course and thanks a lot Sir !",5
2804,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic teacher. From a beginner's perspective, he will tell you exactly what you need to know and what you don't. This course will leave you in the right frame of mind to explore more advanced topics in ML. I will recommend it to anyone who wants to get started in the field of AI. A big thank you to everyone who was involved in the making and maintenance of this course.",5
2805,"Fantastic course, incredibly well taught and very engaging, even as someone who is fairly new in programming and Machine Learning concepts I found this programme very rewarding and feel inspired to continue with what I have learnt. If your debating whether to take it or not, just go for it ~ you won't ve disappointed. Many thanks to Coursera and Andrew Ng for offering such great content.",5
2806,"I greatly enjoyed the course, think it has the perfect balance and depth in the topics it pursues. The teacher Andrew is great. The programming assignments are frustration-free while at the same time give you enough hands-on experience for a first approach at it. Also, I must say that it made me become really interested in Machine Learning and I can't wait to continue learning on my own.",5
2807,"Very good teaching system, amainzinly way of learning, the ""Programming Asignments"" are challenging focus on solving the thoeretical issues and does not make you waste time setting the enviroment, the test makes you re-think and understand the matter. Used to very theoritical way of learning I love this mixture of practise and theory. I really enjoy this trainging ... great great job !!!",5
2808,"Absolutely brilliant content and even better explanation. I am 42, 3 little kids, working many hours and I still invested time (usually night time) on this because it absolutely deserves it. Thank you so much Andrew and Coursera team. I will not have direct use of this knowledge on my daily work but still find it amazing and hopefully use it in the near future. All the best from Madrid.",5
2809,"Andrew lectures this class very well as is very widely recognised.   I see this course as a resource more than a course.  You do the whole thing one time, and it wasn't easy for me but I got there and I learned a lot about how to approach problem solving along the way. And then you have this resource to refer to going forward whenever you need expert advice on a topic. Thank you Andrew.",5
2810,"Very good course, well organized and setup and strong didactic performance. For a beginner in machine learning you get to know all important algorithms (and mathematics behind it) and how to use them. I would fully recommend this course to everybody interested in machine learning. Please at some day put together a nice written book on this especially with al the comments from Andrew Ng.",5
2811,"I was your virtual student in the Machine Learning course. The course should end in January / 2020, but time has flown by and I unknowingly reached the end.",5
2812,"Unbelievable course, I'd strongly recommend that anyone remotely interested in artificial intelligence should take it. The instructor is phenomenal, you'll gain tons of valuable skills and understand many aspects of ML in ways that you wouldn't otherwise learn in school or through using ML libraries in your code. Overall, great investment of both time and money to earn this certificate.",5
2813,"Well structured crash course on ML. Giving the intuition behind the algorithms helps in getting a mental picture of whats happening. Gradual progression from linear regression to OCR, covering a wide variety of algorithms along the way helps in appreciating the breadth of ML. Nice explanations, well documented errata, timely mentor help through discussion forums. Loved doing the course.",5
2814,"For a class that covers a lot of complex information, Professor Ng organized and presented it all in a near frictionless manner.  Upon reviewing the material, I was surprised to see how much ground had been covered in such a short time.  I was able to complete all the programming exercises with perhaps one or two cursory glances at the discussion boards.  A very well constructed course.",5
2815,Great course! Professor Ng is really a great teacher and knows what to contain and what to only describe briefly. I think later I will go on to the Machine Learning specialization by deeplearning.ai.,5
2816,"I enjoyed this course. It takes you through all the algorithms that are popular in Machine learning and one gets to code the actual learning of the algorithm, which is a 10. The course does not require much linear algebra knowledge but it's worthwhile to have some working knowledge of linear algebra. I also liked the discussion forums since there was always an answer if one had a query.",5
2817,"I am a physics postgraduate student and want to take a career in the field of computer science. Although I learned some related mathematica course at the undergraduate stage, this course still gives lots of intuition why the algorithm is designed in such a way, how to obtain the information from the massy data and how to improve our algorithm based on our data. Thanks very much, Andrew.",5
2818,"Although I have not finished it yet I certanly believe it to be an outstanding course. It gives a good insight into the many aspects comprised by 'Machine Learning'. Obviously is not, and neither intended to be, as comprehensive as it's presential counterpart CS229. In my opinion it offers a good balance of math/theory and some hands on experience in the form of programming assignments.  ",5
2819,"I just finished the course and I'm astonished. Thank you Prof. Ng for the immense amount of work that you must have dedicated to organize the subjects in a logical order, and later to record all the videos in a way that is easy to follow. Thank you Mentors, especially Tom Mosher (and your programming tutorials!). I rate it 5/5 an am really grateful for the opportunity to learn so much.",5
2820,"You will need some background on statistics and mathematics to get the most out of this course, but if you are not familiar with those, Professor Ng makes the explanations so clear that you will learn Machine Learning even without a deep knowledge. An introductory to intermediate course, but certainly the best course to get started on the Machine Learning universe. Thanks a lot Andrew!",5
2821,"Very good course as an introduction to Machine Learning, and gives a good base and understanding on the techniques used. Taught very well, and though the programming exercises may have been a bit hand-holdy, the focus really was on understanding how the techniques and algorithms worked. Would recommend, and I hope most courses in Coursera were made to at least this standard of quality.",5
2822,"I came in with very limited knowledge about Machine Learning. Professor Ng has put together a really great course for getting familiar with what's going on ""under the hood"" with systems we encounter every day, like image recognition. The programming exercises were challenging for me, but the forums were supportive and helpful.  A big thanks to Dr. Ng and the mentors for a great course!",5
2823,I took time to grasp every thing as much as possible even though I am still not comfortable using MATLAB or Octave for the programming part of this course. But this course is not about that. All of my effort and time has been more than worth to this. I would suggest anyone blindfolded to take this course and not only for the sake of gaining a certificate but to actually learn about ML.,5
2824,Thank you for the excellent and clear way of describing rather complex topics.,5
2825,"Had a terrific time learning from the material provided and the lectures are, simply put, an amazing source of inspiration and knowledge. Big thank you to Andrew Ng for having such an educational outlook on how to teach a student new material. Can strongly recommend this course to anyone browsing the site and considering picking up Machine Learning. This is the place to start for sure.",5
2826,"This course provides clear explanations for the machine learning algorithms, and topics. Programming assignments are very useful for materializing mathematical foundations of the topics. Professor NG provides perfect explanations for the each topic. Even this course was started couple of years ago, content is still up-to-date. Thank you for this oportunity. I got alot from this course.",5
2827,"Really instructive and well-constructed course. Something that could be improved: the assignments are repetitive and focus too much on how to implement cost functions, gradients etc in Octave instead of focusing on how to use these techniques and algorithms well. Both aspects are important in my opinion. The quizzes test this aspect but they should be completed with the practical work.",5
2828,What a fantastic journey. Finally I have done this course although I did not expect I can do that in time. The whole learning experience is so exciting! Thanks Andrew and Coursera provided such wonderful study opportunity. ,5
2829,This is an excellent course and probably one of the best foundation course in Machine Learning!! I would like to thank Mr. Andrew Ng for explaining us the topics in a very lucid manner. Also the review questions and the assignments are really helpful to understand the topics in practice. I would like to recommend this course to everyone as starting point for ML. Thank you very much!!!!,5
2830,"This was a challenging course, but it was well worth it! I started the course with poor linear algebra skills, and that made some of the exercises difficult. However, completing the exercises helped improve both my abilities in linear algebra as well as machine learning. I'm extremely satisfied, as it was time well spent. Thank you Andrew Ng and Coursera for offering this great course!",5
2831,Great course.,5
2832,"This is the first course i follow on coursera and I'm really impressed. I love that every formula is thoroughly explained and the explanations are easy to understand. Moreover, I feel that the exercises are really well-chosen and I like that there are optional items to solve too.",5
2833,I just finished this course and now dare say I do know and completely understand why all people say this course is the best one and recommend this for beginners. It was a such help to understand overall not only machine learning system but also lots of mathematical conceptions which were such burdens for me.  I'd like to give many appreciates to the prof and lots of assistances of him!,5
2834,"Excellent presentation of the material, providing not only the mathematical concepts but the context in which they are used. Definitely taught as well as my best classes at university, and far above the worst. I believe it could only benefit from some earlier discussion on vectorization vs. using loops, but I enjoyed the challenge of solving that on my own. Thank you for offering this!",5
2835,One of the most fascinating courses I have a ever taken during my academical life.,5
2836,"This course was very interesting, and I have learnt many new things which will prove to be useful when I enter into the workforce. There were many new concepts, and they were taught engagingly and clearly. The programming exercises provided very good practice for applying the concepts that we learnt, and also provides a way to immediately apply these codes into real life applications. ",5
2837,"It turns out that Andrew Ng is a great teacher (only the real ones will know lol). But in all seriousness, this class is a great primer for Machine Learning that still holds up nine years later. I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to get into ML and has a bit of spare time on their hands, especially if you redo the programming exercises in Python. You will not regret it!",5
2838,"Very Interactive and highly involving, High school level Linear Algebra, Probability and Calculus is required.",5
2839,"Great course for a practical overview of ML techniques. Andrew sir is a great instructor! This course is an absolute staple for every beginner in ML. Gives a very good understanding of the overall concepts of various ML algorithms and also emphasizes the practical application of each algorithm (error metrics, ML pipeline, bias/variance trade-offs), which is so important to understand.",5
2840,"I knew almost nothing about ML before starting this course and now I feel that I've put a loot of things in my toolbox to start building things! This is a long way to go, but this course is definitely a good starting point. I'd like to thank the mentors and the community helping a lot building such a rich knowledge and special thanks to Andrew for being such a humble and good teacher!",5
2841,"It is an excellent course to learn machine learning.  I highly recommend this course to students who
are interested in machine learning.  Professor
Andrew Ng is very knowledgeable and (lecturer) explains very well.     Mentors provided quick response to the
queries. I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this course.  If you are interested in machine learning don’t
miss this course!!",5
2842,The course is great for introduction but I believe that it is a little bit all over the place. I didn't really appreciate the claim that a person is an expert by following up on just one course. You need experience and in depth knowledge of the techniques to be an expert. It is a good start that road though. ,5
2843,"Andrew Ng pitches the course just right. Many presentations I've seen are so highly mathematical (which isn't by itself bad) that they ignore the practical aspects, which is what interests most people. Andrew Ng is more concerned that the students understand than that they get how smart Andrew Ng is. He will not waste your time, but scatters pearls with both hands. Highly recommended!",5
2844,"This training was spot on for someone like me with an Engineering MSc but who had not practiced his maths and programming for a very long time. It was very accessible, yet challenging and stretching. I loved the methodology, the pace, the structure. I also felt I was covering a lot of ground on the broad topic of ML in little time and it was well worth the investment. Very well done !",5
2845,"This is an excellent course. The instructor provides extremely clear explanations, both from the theoretical viewpoint as well as regarding the intuition of the ideas underlying the algorithms. The course provides a complete overview of the field in a concise manner. The exercises help absorb and understand the material. Strongly recommended to anyone wishing to learn (and work hard).",5
2846,"Andrew is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Externally smart and articulated, but also super thoughtful and humble to explain the easiest things assuming we might not know. Assignments were challenging, but forums and mentors were totally worth it. This was a very hard class for me (non technical background), but the best online class that made me engaged all the way to the end. ",5
2847,The maths got a bit complicated at times and the Octave programming work was challenging to say the least but these are positive points. Sometimes similar courses are sometimes too easy and pitched at the beginner. This is certainly an intermediate to advanced course but I'd recommend it 100% to anyone who is thinking about gaining a deeper insight to how machine learning models work. ,5
2848,"Course was really well done and very educational.  I'm glad I went through this course to get some of the underlying concepts of machine learning rather than jumping right into applied machine learning.  Some of the linear algebra was a bit confusing to follow for someone rusty in that area, so I found the ""essence of linear algebra"" videos by 3blue1brown very helpful as a refresher.",5
2849,"the lecture is very well presented and very easily understandable; the quiz are good to test the understanding; the programming excercise are really helpful. the first time I did not do the excercise and I forgot the material quickly; second time, I spend time to work out each programming excercise and it helped greatly to understand. thank you a lot Prof. Ng for offering this class.",5
2850,"Le contenu du cours est à la fois riche et accessible aux néophytes. L'enseignant fait preuve d'une pédagogie remarquable, qui permet à des personnes sans culture mathématique particulière de suivre le fil de la réflexion et de réellement comprendre la matière. Les exercices sont difficiles mais permettent d'appliquer concrètement les notions étudiées dans les vidéos. C'est parfait !",5
2851,"This is the best course on machine learning, it covers all the topics in-depth, and also the programming exercises are very fun and productive to do. I would recommend taking this course if you are a beginner in the machine learning domain and would like to know all the things, from their basics and fundamentals. And I would like to thank Andrew Ng Sir, for making such a good course.",5
2852,"I came to this course to get introduction and awareness about machine learning. Content and flow of the course introduced me to ML such gradual, incremental way that, i waited for my Friday evening to arrive and resume where I have left previous Sunday. It enabled me to decide YES I can learn ML and possibly some other aspects of data science and/or AI. I will take next step forward.    ",5
2853,"This course is exactly what I needed. After studying mathematics and mathematical statistics for 5 years, I still found myself not knowing what to do when given some real world data and problems. After completing this course, I feel ready to at least handle whatever project gets thrown my way. I am forever grateful to Andrew Ng for being an excellent teacher! Thank you, Andrew Ng! :)",5
2854,This was the first course I completed on Coursera and I absolutely loved it!! It is very well structured. Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher who explains every single topic patiently and makes it crystal clear.  The quizzes and especially the programming exercises were of great help in deepening understanding of concepts and gave an opportunity for hands-on application of the theory. ,5
2855,The course materials do an amazing job of explaining the concepts and you will leave this course with a much better understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning than you had going in. It is a bit of a grind but I can see after finishing the entire course why this is the flagship MOOC on the Coursera platform and a really good place to start if you have any interest in AI/ML.,5
2856,Andrew's Machine Learning course is very interesting. He made the topic very interesting. The content and ordering of the course is very well designed. Questions in the quiz were thought-provoking and programming assignments were designed and documented so well that it only helped in furthering the understanding of the concepts. Thank you very much for such a fun learning experience.,5
2857,If I could give it 10 stars- I would.,5
2858,"Great course to learn Machine Learning from scratch. Provides fundamental knowledge ground up with the right rigor for a online course. You are tested all along using lecture quizzes, programming assignments and weekly quizzes. ",5
2859,"A must-take course on machine learning. Ng covered all the fundamental concepts in the field. His lecturing was vivid and full of interesting examples. Sure he has an accent. But I had no problem understood him. After a while, I even started to like his accent. I also enjoyed his ""nerdy"" jokes. Thank you for preparing such an awesome course and made it accessible to anybody for free!",5
2860,"Great and insightful course to get started on machine learning. I have always been fascinated by the things that one can achieve by using machine learning but now that I have a better understanding of the logic behind it, it is time for me to come up with newer, better and more fascinating applications, all thanks to this course. I am fully charged and curious to learn more about ML.",5
2861,This should officially be the first course for every ML enthusiast to undergo as Prof Andrew gives a complete guide to not only understand basic ML algorithms and how /when to apply them but developing a holistic experience for all.Personally I find Prof. Andrew's voice very soothing :)A million thanks to Prof. Andrew and his team at Coursera for keeping this course available to all.,5
2862,Really well taught and taught in a way that makes it easy for people with very little knowledge of the subject to comprehend well and also understand its areas of application and how what was taught in the class can be used.,5

2865,"This was a great hands on introduction to machine learning. It really teaches you the fundamentals and gives you a grasp of what can be done and how to succeed in applying machine learning. You'll definitely need to keep up the work and try to apply these concepts soon after taking the course to really get a grasp of how to use them in practice, but it felt like a great introduction.",5
2866,Prof. Ng was awesome in this course. He really spent time making machine learning understandable to novice like me new to ML concepts. He spend time going into the details and explaining the concepts. It was a great experience for me and I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to acquire knowledge and apply machine learning in their current profession or as a new career. ,5
2867,"This class does not require any statistical knowledge. Instead, it is based on Calculus, Linear Algebra and Optimization. It has an unified format: minimize the cost function.  If you know Linear Algebra well, you will find those programming practices only need a few lines by using matrix and vector.",5
2868,A Big Thank You from the bottom of my heart to Andrew Ng sir and entire team.,5
2869,"This is an extremely well taught course.  I recommend taking it after learning Linear Algebra.  ""The Analytics Edge"" through MITx (EdX.org) complements this course nicely.  It would have been nice if the programming assignments had been a little more challenging.",5

",5
2872,This is my first experience taking an online course this long and I must say that Andrew NG has put together all the material in a masterful way. It was easy to follow and easy to understand. The programming exercises were challenging and made the subject enjoyable. I recommend this course to anyone having an interest in ML and AI. Can't wait to start applying my new knowledge. Jose ,5
2873,"I'm indebted to the Coursera platform for providing such great quality content from world-class professors and making it available for the whole world at large. Never in my life, I came across someone like Prof. Dr. Andrew Ng, his way of explaining things is very lucid and also relates every lecture on the application part of it in the industry. He is an inspiration. Thank you, sir. ",5
2874,"Although the course doesn't help with programming skills in python or R for Machine Learning, it is amazingly good for understanding the mathematics and the reasoning behind the most common ML algorithms. This in turn helps you better fine tune your algorithm as well as make better decisions like what algorithm to use, what to change to improve, and how to find room for improvement.",5
2875,"Best course I have seen so far on the introductory concepts of Machine Learning. The course doesn't only go into the mathematical details behind learning algorithms , but also focuses on the implementation of these algorithms. Lectures, slides, and assignments are very targeted and clearly explained to teach specific skills. I am really glad that I spent time to work on this course!  ",5
2876,"This is the best class for Machine Learning Beginners. All basic aspects are covered in depth, and practice exercises gives a good hands on experience. Python Enthusiasts can try taking the hands on exercise, and easily replicate in Python. ",5

Thanks to Andrew Ng for this amazing course! ",5
2878,"It's quite lucky to have Andrew Ng's course here. I am a student from China. Beginning learning machine learning, I have found lots of references, information, and a batch of other courses. But it didn't help me a lot. Nonetheless, when I took these courses, even though the language is a big problem, I overcame it, and I obtained many bits of knowledge, finally. Thank you very much!",5
2879,"Thank you Andrew Ng. I have learned a lot from this course. What more important is studying this course makes me feel like back to University again, I spend about 5-6 hours a week after working learning this, instead of wasting my time on TV shows and PC games. This course gives me passion to learn and I will take other Andrew's courses! Thank you Andrew again, I'm your big fan now.",5
2880,This is a great introduction to the domain which worth the time spend on it. I've got a really big pleasure while taking the course and also I've got a really useful information which could be applied in my professional interests and improve myself as a technical expert.

It has encouraged me to explore applied mathematics and numerical methods in greater depths. I felt happy after finishing each and every programming exercise. Upon completion of the course I can say with great joy that, ""it's just the beginning"".",5
2883,"Fantastic intro course. In my opinion the course thoroughly excels at giving a thorough conceptual overview of popular machine learning algorithms. However the course sacrifices a lot of detail (and difficulty) for the sake of accessibility. After finishing the course, I recommend students continue to wade deeper into the material with greater mathematical (and programmatic) rigor.",5
2884,"This class was my introduction to Machne Learning and this was exactly what I needed. I enjoyed the whole process, videos and Andrew Ng's presentations were very understandable. This class gives you a broad and detailed picture about Machine Learning world, however, it leaves traits for further development and gives advice about where to look and how to develop in machine learning.",5
2885,The course is very clear and tackles all the topics with high precision. This is the result of the excellent work done by the instructor and the platform itself that permit lot of tools to follow the lessons. ,5
2886,"Excellent course. Andrew was amazing. He explained everything so well. Detailed everything. He breaks down big problems into small little chunks. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to have an overview of how machine learning works and how to apply it. In the final week, Andrew shares his experience so that you don't have to make the same mistakes as he did. AMAZING.",5
2887,"This is really an outstanding class. To say just one thing, the greatest value of it is the tools that Pr. Ng provides to understand how to design, debug, analyze and optimize ML systems. Algorithms have evolved since the class was designed (and still will) but the expertise and insight given by these tools to ML practionners remain valid. Is there another class after this one? :-)",5
2888,"Great course, great teacher. Fun programming excercises. I liked that the mathematical concepts behind every machine learning algorithm were explained clearly, but without going into the deepest of the mathematical demonstrations, which are may be unnecesary to understand how the algorithms work and the reason why they get to learn. Thank you for having this useful curse available.",5
2889,"Andrew Ng is an amazing instructor, and was able to make a pretty complicated topic a lot of fun to study. The videos are clear and on point, and programming exercises after each week allow to try out everything you just learned. Besides that, the Octave code from programming exercises is extremely easy to adapt for other ML problems to play around with real data from your problem. ",5
2890,"Enjoyed learning some basics of machine learning very much. Although I am a bit far from programming, this was not an obstacle. Hope what I have learnt will be helpful in a project I would like to do. ",5
2891,"Needless to say, this is a legendary course that, I think, got most of us started in machine learning. Although there were cases where it felt like the contents were not exactly ""noob-friendly"", it was still quite well-organized in the overall sense. It has been a pleasure for me to take the time to finish this course. Andrew Ng deserves a huge thanks for making these great videos.",5
2892,"I wish all courses were like this one. Andrew Ng is amazing - he has great knowledge (both theoretical and pratical), he seems so passionate about topic and he knows how to teach. And he always answered all my questions in videos even I can't ask him. He knows what can be a struggle for his students and he tries to prevent it. It took me a lot of time but every second was valuable.",5
2893,"I would say a must for who wants to have a serious yet approachable introduction to machine learning. The course doesn't shy away from the mathematics involved and doesn't cut corners but eases you into the logic, theory and practice about as much as it is necessary to gain a good understanding of what's under the hood of a very hyped topic such as AI or artificial neural networks.",5
2894,This is the first online course that I have completed. Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher who makes us understand the working of complex algorithms and maths in a simple and fun way while also giving practical tips on the implementation. I would recommend this course to everyone who has even a slight bit of interest in machine learning to get a good grasp on the basics of the subject. ,5
2895,The course lectures were very well organized and really enjoyed doing all the programming exercises given at the end of a weeks lecture. The concepts were very clearly conveyed and the intuition was very well demonstrated in the exercises as well. Learned a lot taking this course and thank you professor Andrew Ng and courseera for giving me this wonderful learning experience.   :),5
2896,The course dives in depth in Machine Learning but is also very interesting to learn with Andrew's patient teaching. Thanks a lot to  Andrew. There's so much to learn from both your curriculum design and practical information  as well as clear therotical math conduction. Really appreciate Coursera for providing such excellent course. The honor goes to everyone who works in Coursea!,5
2897,"Andrew Ng's explanations were very clear and easy to follow. The programming exercises were well-written and guided students through every step of the implementation process. The time and effort that was put into developing this course was outstanding, and I'm extremely thankful of Andrew Ng and other contributors who made this course as easily accessible and well-taught as it is. ",5
2898,"An absolutely fantastic course to undertake, and ignite your interest in machine-learning. Andrew sir covers quite a few important topics  in great detail, with lucid, and easy to understand real world examples . The programming assignments will help you appreciate the applications of the topics  you've  learnt , and the quizzes are fun too. Would recommend this course to everyone",5
2899,I'm highly satisfied after completing this awesome course after some initial delay from my side. It got in depth knowledge about some of the basic and important topics of machine learning. This course also helped me to learn Matlab which I had not thought about learning before. Overall it was a great experience and now I'm looking forward towards other great courses from Coursera.,5
2900,"Amazing course.  Andrews teaching style is amazing.  My one gripe would be that I wish we could have spent a little more time reviewing/learning Octave.  I spent a little too much time trying to get through a new language syntax on top of learning new algorithms.  That aside, I would recommend this course to anybody wanting to really understand the foundations of Machine Learning.  ",5
2901,"The best machine learning introductory course! I know nothing about ML before, even after completing this, I still feel like an amateur and need to learn more, but this course gave you an ample machine learning knowledge with the right amount of difficulty.",5
2902,Very helpful and easy way for learning Machine Learning. Thank Prof. Andrew Ng and Coursera.,5
2903,I'd rather rate it around 4.5 but there was no option. The reason because programming exercises. Teaching method and lectures were perfect but exercises were more of a puzzle than learning exercises. You could stay stuck for pretty much no reason. I'd hope that they make it more simple to interpret as reading a 15-page document just for changing 3 lines of code is really annoying.,5
2904,"The course was well laid out with all the required and basic concepts. The biggest advantage of this course over any other Machine Learning course is Sir Andrew Ng. He was just exceptional, calm and patient in explaining all the concepts with great clarity and detail. He made the course interactive and engaging for me and i hope everyone who take this course will find this useful.",5
2905,"Prof. Ng did a great job breaking down complex topics in to manageable pieces. His approach was very engaging. Its amazing how he can manage to explain complicated topics in simple terms. Backpropagation in Week 5 could have been taught slightly better, but that does not discount how well the course was organized and executed. I would love to take more courses offered by Prof. Ng.",5
2906,Mr Ng has very beautifully explained the machine learning concepts in this course. It has introduced me to machine learning and I frequently refer it for getting the basic concepts right. I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning the basics instead of directly going into implementation which may be just few lines of code using the modern ML frameworks.,5
2907,"A great course for anyone interested in theory and real world application of machine learning algorithms. Sometimes it's math heavy so you might end up struggling to fully grasp the concept, but eventually you'll understand what is the core idea behind the topic. I enjoyed the way the material is presented and really appreciate real world examples and application of ML technology.",5
2908,"A great way to get introduced to the fascinating topic that is Machine Learning. Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers I've ever come across! If you are beginning your journey into ML, like I am, then this should ideally be your first step. My only fear now is that all the other ML and Deep Learning classes I plan to take won't be as enjoyable or well taught as this class. Cheers!",5
2909,"It's actually a good fundamental course of machine learning basic concepts and skills. However, it's far not enough to master the principal skill of machine learning if you don't learn further courses about machine learning. By the way, the programming exercises is designed so well which worth a lot of trials and time. It would be better if more programming exercises are assigned.",5
2910,"Really great. Good pace, good explanations, nice programming exercises to ensure understanding of the subject. ",5
2911,"One of the best mooc that I have taken till date. Thanks a lot for Andrew Ng and team to make this high quality class accessible to everyone.

2919,Really a great job from the teacher to teach this class online. He made me understand a complicated topic as it is machine learning and im gratefull of that. Same as the platform that gave me and the other students of the course the facility of the forum to ask questions and the develop segments of the course. It also made me improve my english and im happy about that. Thank you.,5
2920,"I very appreciate the effort of the professor on such a logical and systematic course, which is better than any other online courses I have ever taken. Maybe I think it would be better if there are more programming assignments on the further application of machine learning, such as Photo OCR in the last week. That is more amazing and can improve students'  practical skills a lot.",5
2921,"The programming exercise was great to grasp images to learn the subject.  The description about back forward propagation was also helpful, which had been difficult to understand it with other books's for me.",5
2922,"Great course, useful content, right balance between theory and practical exercises, taught by Prof Andrew Ng who is exceptional not only in teaching effectively the topics covered in the course but also passing on to you his passion for machine learning. You will not only learn machine learning techniques but also valuable guidance for applying it in practice. Highly recommended.",5
2923,This is a very good course on Machine Learning. It starts with foundations and goes on to show how the different algo are used in real life projects.,5
2924,Very interesting overview of machine learning and all the different methods used within that field.  It starts off somewhat daunting (after week 1) but once you get the hang of it and catch on to the standard algorithms and programming techniques it becomes more natural.  I will most definitely be putting this class on my resume and hopefully it will help in my coming job search!,5
2925,"Loved the course!  Very clear lectures.  The programming assignments are just the right level of difficulty to reinforce the lectures without making me feel lost.  Only minus is  that the course feels a bit dated, with lots of known errata and no mention of more recent developments such as convolutional or recurrent neural networks.  Would love to see an updated version released!",5
2926,"I have enjoyed this course very much. I can't recommend it more fore those who want a hands on approach to understanding machine learning. The structure is perfect, the explanations very clear, and it strikes the right balance when discussing the math behind the algorithms. The programming exercises are a perfect complement to the lessons, helping to consolidate what you learnt. ",5
2927,"An excellent introduction to Machine Learning for those who are not familiar with the subject, it seemed to be very difficult at the beginning of the course, however with the videos and exercises you start to become familiar with the topic. Thanks to Professor Andrew Yan-Tak Ng and the instructors, especially Tom Mosher, without him I probably wouldn't have completed the course.",5
2928,I invite others to learn this course when i started learning this course i know little about machine learning  but i see my self where i am i am surprised on this course i think everyone befor start learning any oline course about machine learning first must vist this lesson may God bless you Andrew for helping us i am from Ethiopia i will try to introduce this course for others ,5

2942,This class was really helpful and insightful for beginners to the Machine learning like me. The explanation was right on the spot and Andrew is a great teacher. He has a knack to explain complex things in a much simpler and easy way for everyone to understand. I certainly believe this will help me progress in my career.,5
2943,"Great course to get an overview and detail of what ML is all about. Real applications and math that explains the logic and reasoning behind the algorithm. This class is not for the faint of heart because of the linear algebra/matrix math and programming exercise. However, if you have programming background and math you'll do just fine. I love this class and highly recommend it.",5
2944,"  This course is fabulous!! The participants will learn what the types of technology are, they will learn the parts of an advance maths topics, and they will learn how to formulate/structure maths into program through python. Thank you so very much, Coursera and Professor Chapman!!! I have learned a significant amount of information which have enhanced my machine learning skills.  ",5
2945,"Great intro to ML, Andrew's concise yet laid back style is consistently fun and motivating. Some mathematical foundations are glossed over, but the interested student can read up on these elsewhere in his own time without missing the gist of the course. I only wish I'd had professors as patient and motivated (and motivating!) as Andrew when I was a student. Well worth the time!",5
2946,"Great course for students who are doing their first steps in Machine Learning.The course is very didactic and the programming exercises help to understand & implement the theoretical material.

I really enjoyed taking this class and really hope seeing a Machine Learning II course in a near future. Thanks to prof. Ng for the great course!",5
2948,"As someone who's not that great with maths, I was afraid I wouldn't like this course, but luckily I was wrong. I'd say you only need to know the basics of calculus to do well in this course. As for machine learning, most of the core concepts have been covered with enough explanation, examples, and hands-on exercises. A great learning experience overall. Huge respect for Andrew! ",5
2949,"This course was great, very well explained. Everything is motivated so we always feel that we're learning useful things. Maybe one problem is that the exercices tend to hide how much boring work it takes to put up a program with the correct data, import it and eveything (since we only have to complete the core). But that goes along with the fact that exercices are a lot of fun.",5
2950,The material and presentation were excellent.   As an introduction to Machine Learning I felt that I was able to learn a great deal and well worth the investment..   One small criticism would be that the supplementary written material could have been clearer and more organized to match what was in the quizzes.   Despite this small issue overall I felt it was well worth my time.,5
2951,"It's an incredible course. When I wanted to learn ML, I was under a lot of thought process... where to learn... which course to take and all.... After a lot of search, it was so obvious that this is the best course available online. It was a great experience to not only learn just the concepts but also the way to apply them properly and good set of advises.",5
2952,"I have to admit that Andrew is probably one of the best when it comes to explain ML concepts. I have a engineering background and therefore, for me both application as well as the math part of ML is interesting. And Andrew is great at explaining both sides of things. I would love to see more advanced ML courses taught by Andrew on Coursera. I hope someone listens to my plea :).",5

2954,"For people interested in Machine Learning, this course will give you a very good insight (both technical and analytical) of what you should know about machine learning algorithms. The contents were really good, but I truly believe the success of this course is related to the teacher (Andrew Ng). Clearly, he has remarkable ability to teach and a strong knowledge about the topic.",5
2955,"This was an amazing course. I didn't have a sense for the depth of knowledge that I would get when I started this class. My expectation was a flyover of the basic Machine Learning concepts. Professor Ng wasted no time letting us roll up our sleeves and dive right in to the heart of ML. I loved the presentation style, the pace and tools used in this Coursera class. Thank you!!!",5
2956,"Ao mesmo tempo em que pude fazer uma sólida revisão em Álgebra Linear, pude ter uma compreensão bem mais profunda das técnicas e algoritmos utilizados no treinamento das ferramentas mais comuns utilizadas em inteligência artificial. O curso foi duro, me tomou 7 semanas de praticamente sete a oito horas por dia, mas foi muito gratificante quando recebi meu certificado ao final. ",5
2957,"Amazing Course Content. Thank you a lot to Instructor Andrew Ng. My learning enjoyment for Machine learning has been superb with solid foundations as base for further development.

2958,This course is a must for any engineer who wants to excel in the field of artificial intelligence. Professor Ng takes you from the basics all the way to complicated concepts. The classes are very informative and easy to understand. The programming assignments challenge you to implement the algorithms more effectively. Taking this course is one of the best decisions of my life.,5
2959,"The course is very well structured. easy to follow and give a whole introductory overview of the topic. As a physicist by formation, I found sometimes difficult changing defining something like a row vector and implementing it as a column vector (or vice versa), but maybe it is only my problem. Apart from that, I enjoyed the course very much and thank you for Andrew making it. ",5
2960,"It's the best Machine Learning course in the market. Not only it details the most up-to-date algorithm and industry practice in machine learning, it also provides the theory and math behind it.

It really deepened my interest in the subject and kept me motivated throughout the whole course. Really awesome! I strongly recommend to whoever is interested in the subject.,5
2998,"Absolutely phenomenal. Great introductory machine learning course, but also introduces some of the great nitty-gritty details that inquisitive people will appreciate. Sometimes, if you are very inquisitive about mathematical detail, like I am, you will need to use outside resources (I mostly found Youtube lectures to be adequate for this purpose). Thank you so much Prof. Ng!",5
2999,Really great course.  I'm glad I persisted and completed this course as it now allows me to better understand concepts related to machine learning. I tried reading a book on this subject prior to this course and nothing sank in. After completing this course I was able to fully understand the same text book.

Thank you for teaching me machine learning! ,5
3001,Its a great starting step to enter the world of ML. The author Andrew NG really made it simple and not-so-rocketscience approach to boost the confidence and eliminate the technical discomfort that we may face.,5
3002,"I‘m pretty thank you for your classes. You made me have a chance to learn ML from you through online course. You know not everyone could have a chance to go to Standford  University and listen to your classes. But you really make more people like me have a chance to get it on Coursera. Thank you very much,  my respectable teacher. Give my best wishes to you, Andrew Ng. 非常感谢！",5
3003,My understanding of ML which I have taken to Deep Learning was built on Andrew's excellent course.  The exercises were developed as building blocks and reinforcing concepts.  The emphasis on vector methods assisted me with later work in Neural Networks.  I continually go back and use the exercises and course for review.  I completed and gained a certificate from this course.,5
3004,"Great course. The content is very well organised, each and every one of the videos are highly interesting and Professor Andrew Ng is amazingly good. The course provides a practical view of ML with a good balance between theory and application. The practical examples are very well structured and provide good hand-on experience using Octave/Matlab. In short, simply excellent.",5

Avant de débuter ce cours je n'avais aucune connaissance en machine learning mais maintenant je me sens deja prête à appliquer directement tout ce que j'ai appris. Pour finir je recommande vivement ce cours .,5
3007,"The cource content and teaching methodology is great. I would have loved more independence in assginments and a little bit higher difficulty in quizes though. In most of the assignments, I missed what one learns while solving a porblem from scratch. Most of the problems were already structured and most of the code was already provided. Still, an awesome learning experience.",5
3008,"I was newbie in machine learning and this course helped me so much to understand the basic things of machine learning. I also have learned some advanced topics and some well set strategies of machine learning approaches. The assignments are so much organised that those are very easy to understand and code. Overall, this is a nice course to get started with machine learning.",5

It probably helps that it is a very cool topic, but its also very well taught.  very engaging, sufficiently challenging coding problems to be challenging, and great support available via Forums.  Flexible pace was key.  allowed me to drop back and address a surge at work, then resume class without worry.  Loved it.",5
3012,"While doing this course, I was surprised at how simple machine learning is, but in retrospect, I feel that this reflects the quality of the instruction in the course. A complex topic has been broken down into parts that are readily digestible, and deliver a good understanding of an increasingly important field. I've already started using some of these techniques in my work!",5
3013,"One of the best courses I have been taken ever. And may be simple the best. Very balanced, optimal mix of theory, practice, application examples, advices for work process, tools for debagging, performance analysis. Of course, it's just a start, you need to know much more to develop real skills in such complicated area as ML. But is very good introduction. Even now, in 2017.",5
3014,I have learned a lot of things in this course. A special thanks for the mentors for being there every time to give us clarification about the contents. Thanks for the discussion forum that we have been actively engaged since the beginning of the course. Got a quite a lot of help through online group created by our students. A Big Thanks to everyone especially Andrew NG sir.,5

All the surroundings (how to plot best, how to structure the test eviorenment, etc.) are taken care of in the exercise-files. I can highly recommendthis course to everyone interested in Machiene Learning.",5
3018,,5
3019,"Fantastic introduction to machine learning, neural networks, SVM and more. Requires basic linear algebra skills - if you're new to LA - there is a refresher offered in week 1 which tells you everything you need to know. Be warned, some of the lectures and assignments are a bit out of order at the moment - but the discussion boards and course tutorials will set you straight.",5
3020,"This course is amazing, the lecturer is great and extremely sympathetic. It is very difficult to break down such a complex and varied subject so concisely to make it interesting but very clear at the same time. Andrew Ng did this in an extraordinary way.

Thank you !",5
3023,This is the best beginner course in the Machine Learning specialization. I have studied from many different platforms for ML and the best approach and best theoretical knowledge has been provided by this course. After 11 weeks I believe that students can become confident about ML at least for the basic approaches and applications about this area. Appreciate to Andrew N.G..,5
3024,"This course gives in-depth knowledge of important/foundational ML algorithms , the use of MATLAB software for programming purposes, makes the course great for beginners, who have no prior experience in python or R. ",5
3025,The journey for learning Machine Learning course was awesome. Everything was simplified to learn every concept in easy and interesting way relating topics in practice and real world.The quiz and the assignment were very helpful as it helped to understand how much we understood the course and what to read again. It was worth taking this course and I loved and enjoyed a lot. ,5
3026,"Great overview of Machine Learning algorithms with hands-on examples. If you are already a programmer, you will probably find some of this a little slow, but the pace is good for absorbing the vast amount of new concepts.",5
3027,"Goes into the science of Machine Learning unlike other courses that might just introduce to some libraries. If you simply want to practice using toolkits to perform basic analyses, this might not be the course for you. Those interested to learn the basics of how techniques such as regression or neural networks works on a fundamental level definitely should try this course.",5
3028,A great course. Awesome trainer -- Thankyou Andrew Ng.  This course provides a lot of practical insights to applying various machine learning algorithms and their mathematical aspects. The trainer tells you how to approach towards solving lot of machine learning problems and what not to do as well. I am very hopeful that this course will provide a great boost to my career.,5
3029,"Best Course for machine learning out there. Helped me to get a lot of knowledge on the subject. Recommend for anybody who is interested to get intuition of machine learning as many aspects are covered in the lecture series. And the lectures are arranged in the most appropriate manner, and material is covered in a way, so that any body interested would be able to get along.",5
3030,Overall the course is excellent and provides a great understanding of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The course is also quite practical and one gets to apply some of the learnt techniques in the assignments due in for each week. Andrew Ng is very clear in his explanations and knows the subject very well obviously. I would definitely highly recommend it.,5
3031,"I feel very privelledged to live in a time where i can easily access such information, and readily develop new skills to better myself. if you want to get up to speed on this hot topic as fast as possible, then this course is for you. Every single piece of it adds value, and the course is straight to the point. It is of great credit to Andrew and his team to pull this off.  ",5
3032,"Andrew has a rare talent to explain difficult things in a simple way. The education programm start from basics and step by step pass you to the major understanding of ML (machine learning). Visual materials, Quizzes and Coding tasks form complex knowlefge of ML. If you are a new one in the subject this course is the perfect way to get acquainted with ML.",5
3033,I really liked the class. Andrew is a great teacher. Programming assignments are fantastic. I knew some Matlab but I learned a lot more in this class. I also learned how to vectorize certain processes. I strongly recommend this course to people who do not have that much mathematical background but still remember some material from the calculus courses they took in college. ,5
3034,,5
3035,"Wonderful introduction to machine learning. Instructor emphasizes conceptual understanding of many topics and presents the concepts in a coherent and instructive manner. My only objection is that the course sometimes lacks enough mathematical justification behind some formulas used, but I understand that this is only an introduction so I won't complain too much about that.",5
3036,"I have been really impressed with the quality of this course. The subject of the lecures is undoubtedly fascinating, while the teacher, Andrew Ng, is able to introduce even the most complex topics with clarity and effectiveness. The weekly workload is reasonable and carefully planned, as the difficulty of assignments and tests. Many thanks for making this course available!",5
3037,Very valuable course if you just want to start with Machine Learning. The content is explained absolutely understandable even if you are not a math expert. A huge 'Thank you' to Prof. Ng and the other staff who help you through the assignment and problems with nice tutorials and so on. That really helped a lot and kept me being motivated for course competition. Well done!,5
3038,It was very well done. I wish there were some more coding exercises for the later chapters but i understand that is time intensive and difficult to create with high level concepts. Really enjoyed the ability to test programs part of the way through. Kind of wish there was a little less hand holding with the initialization of variables. Most of my programs were one-liners.,5
3039,"Dr. Ng is a very clear explainer of complicated topics. The class was a joy to take. The quizzes and exercises were challenging but not impossible (I have a quantitative educational background, but prior training in computer science). His farewell video to the class was touching; this is a professor who clearly cares deeply about sharing knowledge for the good of mankind.",5
3040,As a beginner in ML i found this course to be very useful. Andrew introduced a variety of topics with proper balance between fundamentals and the math derivation parts. This course has given me tremendous confidence to tackle variety of problems using ML. Andrew is an excellent teacher. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to get started on ML. Thanks.,5
3041,"Being able to learn Machine Learning from Andrew is truly a boon. I'm pretty sure that i wouldn't have been able to go to Stanford given my economic background, so this is the next big thing.The course was impeccable ,I was able to understand some concepts on the first instance because of the clear and concise explanation.Hope to see more of Andrews courses here.Thanks :)",5
3042,Thank you for providing such great courses!,5
3043,"Интересный и увлекательный курс. Правда, практической части относительно мало, но для такой темы с полным подходом понадобилось бы много времени. Курс же раскрывает базовую часть своих свойств и особенностей. Профессор в хорошем настроении =) Спасибо за предоставленную возможность пройти обучение по данному курсу. Успехов команде Coursera и всем, кто начинает данный курс.",5
3044,Amazing!,5
3045,,5
3046,"Andrew was great, I had no previous experience in linear algebra or Octave/Matlab but was still able to complete all the homework and follow along with the videos, due in no small part to Mr. Ng's patient and approachable teaching style. The online mentors also proved to be invaluable. One of the best courses on hard science I have taken, online or in ""real life"" college.",5
3047,"The course explains both theoretical basis and practical application of machine learning. It was very interesting and useful training course, the methods of providing the information are straight and clear, although sometimes requiring additional time in order to perform the tasks (which of course you can expect from mathematical discipline). Highly recommend to anybody!",5
3048,He took all the myths of Machine Learning away and let us know what it actually is. He taught everything so wonderfully. All of the answers were answered by himself during the video and we didn't need to google anything individually. He is one of the best instructors out there when It comes to machine learning. I would definitely take more of his courses in the future IA,5
3049,It is one of the best course on coursera.it is more about algorithm of machine learning that how machine learning algorithm work and what are the mathematics work behind machine learning .This course also contain concept of neural network and there are some real life example related to Machine learning and how they are applied.There is amazing elaboration of every topic.,5
3050,Could not have asked better course to learn something which is so much in vogue these days. The professor and the style is so easy and smooth that you have a very pleasant and turbulence free flight throughout the whole course. Plus you have the forums for support whenever you have any doubt. I will surely recommend this to anyone interested in learning machine learning. ,5
3051,it was really interesting. Going from not even knowing what Machine Learning was to understanding (if not dominating) all the terminology and the basic algorithms in a couple of months is just incredible. The programming exercises make you feel that you could really do it yourself (though I feel a course on Octave / MATLAB would have made them much easier to accomplish).,5
3052,Thank you Sir.,5
3053,"Awesome class. You really learn the fundamentals from this class. However, I would not take this class expecting to learn purely practical skills from this class. I would suggest a different class that is focused more on high level implementation of machine learning. But, if you're really interested how machine learning works under the hood, I would definitely recommend.",5
3054,"An excellent introduction to Machine Learning for beginners. Just the right amount of focus on the underlying mathematical concepts, even while retaining the emphasis on ML's real world applicability. The quizzes and programming assignments keep the students on their toes. The tutorials and discussion groups are an invaluable resource to help navigate through the course. ",5
3055,"Exceptionally well taught.  This filled the gap between the high level knowledge of machine learning from beginner books and the ease of implementing existing libraries in Python (i.e. Scikit learn).  Now I better understand the appropriate algorithm for the purpose, how that algo is producing its results and how better to tune that algorithm to get the best performance. ",5
3056,"This course provides complete information on topics covered but the main strength of the course lies in good example/assignment. Assignments cover almost everything that a student needs to learn while managing to keep the focus of the student at the task, not letting the student drown in the technical details or almost unrelated problems. Highly recommended for starters! ",5
3057,Andrew Ng is a great teacher who breaks down the complex structure of the matter into very student friendly chunks. His use of markings and diagrams through the lesson really helps visualize and understand certain material. The assignments are both fun and can be challenging and are also very good representations of possible real-life applications of the subjects taught.,5
3058,It is a really good course for starting machine learning. I've learned many things and I never regret take this course. I have one advice for course team. I not sure but first five weeks there are reading parts after videos. These parts are very effective for learning and note taking. I think reading parts should be every week after topics. Thank you for all course team.,5
3059,"Before enrolling I have been using machine learning tools for my researches for years; So I'm so surprised when I found that I can loads of new stuff from this seemingly foundational course. There're many excellent advice, and the quiz clears some of the misconception of mine. I definitely recommend it to any beginner or those who aim to conduct machine learning project.",5
3060,A very balanced course for machine learning. It took me from zero knowledge in this field to a point where I can apply it to a great extent to my research. It has elevated my interest in Deep Learning and towards further study in this domain. The way Andrew teaches is simply majestic. I am much thankful to him for all his efforts and I hope to capitalize on them further!,5
3061,I thought this course gave an excellent introduction to the topic of Machine Learning. The lecture videos were well-paced and the accompanying quizzes felt at the right level to test understanding. The programming exercises were in-depth and both challenging and interesting to attempt. I enjoyed the course a lot and finish it feeling keen to learn more about the subject.,5
3062,"I would give this course more than 5 stars if I could. Professor Ng took a lot of time to explain concepts clearly. The programming exercises were well designed to solidify the concepts. The discussions around debugging, ceiling analysis, learning curves and data synthesis provided a lot of practical advice on how to build a machine learning pipeline. Highly recommended!",5
3063,"Such an excellent course on machine learning (ML). I took this course as my first introductory course on ML and I now feel the power and capability to use it in my research and career. Complicated concepts were presented in an easy understandable manner. Me as a university lecturer enjoyed alot on andrew ng style of teaching as well. I wish the bests for him, thank you !",5
3064,"This course is amazing! With lots of caution, support, advice, quizzes, assignments and real-life application examples. I found it to be very encouraging in its introductory approach to advanced concepts. I like the fact that the instructor endeavours to explain advanced concepts in an intuitive way whilst taking due care to highlight where the maths has been overlooked.",5
3065,First MOOC course I have ever taken and it feels like it is the standard to which other MOOC courses should adhere to. Great entry-level course for anyone interested in machine learning. Its worth to me in industry (as a biomedical engineer) remains to be seen but I am confident that I will be able to use the concepts learned in this course to great effect in the future. ,5
3066,"This course is a great introduction to the world of machine learning. The instructor is very thorough about each topic. I believe that I can now take what I have learned in this class and start applying the knowledge to real world problems.  I do find sometimes that the requirements for the programming assignments can be a bit vague, but the forms help to close the gaps.",5
3067,"Although I've only completed 2 week's of material, I found this to be extremely interesting. The videos are very good, assignments are excellent to better the understanding and the course seems to be understandable if some one has minimum but more than zero knowledge on linear algebra and programming. Great course, truly enjoying as I'm well ahead of my all deadlines :-) ",5
3068,"Great for learning ML basics and helped me a lot learning how to code in Matlab, which has been very useful to me since I have a whole course involving this coding tool in my Bachelor's degree. ",5
3069,"The course was amazing. The teaching style of Professor Andrew NG was purely amazing. Infact, he taught some of the most complicated things in such a manner that it seems like a piece of cake for me. Not only things related to this course but also some of the side topics taught in this course are also great. Many thanks to the Coursera Community and Professor Andrew NG.",5
3070,Amazing hability of Andrew Ng to explain complex things in an understandable way !,5
3071,这是我上过的最精彩的网课，衷心感谢吴恩达老师的细心讲解！建议大家一定要做网站上的测验和编程练习，如果只是看视频不动手编程，那这门课你只能学到一半而已。,5

3106,This course was really helpful to build my foundation in machine learning and understanding its applied algorithms. Andrew's style of teaching and explanation was really straight and understandable. I appreciate coursera for putting such a tutorial for learners and I would highly recommend to any one who wish to start their career in machine learning and data science.,5
3107,I had to admit that the first 2-3 weeks can be quite difficult but after you wrap your head around the main concepts and math it's been the best moment of the week for me. Now I'm excited to keep learning with a solid base :) . I'll start the Deep Learning Specialization as soon as I can after the holidays. Thanks Andrew Ng and the Coursera team to make this possible.,5
3108,"Excellent course, blending fundamentals of Machine learning with aspects of practical application. I thoroughly enjoyed attending the class and going through programming assignments that cover a number of practically meaningful topics (e.g. digits recognition, compression algorithms, and recommender systems). I highly recommend this outstanding course to all students.",5
3109,"Dr. Ng put an incredible amount of work into this course. This is by far the most organized course I have taken on coursera. His approach was very thorough and followed a natural pedagogy, so students with varying levels of experience should be able to understand the material and be successful. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to making this course available!",5
3110,,5
3111,"All the course is very, very interesting and inspiring.",5
3112,The teacher is very structured and the material is greatly constructed!    I also loved the way the exercises covered complex exemples without demanding an extraordinary amount of time to complete!   They become a valuable ressource to review and put in practice the concepts later on!,5
3113,Learnt a lot. ,5
3114,Thank you so much Pro. Andrew Ng for the whole course. This Machine learning course is super helpful for me to understand different types of supervised and unsupervised learning models. I deeply believe that machine learning will change many industries in the near future and I am willing to be part of it. Thank you again and looking forward to start other AI courses.,5
3115,This is an extremely valuable course to take on the topic of machine learning. The course is very well defined and have plenty of examples from various backgrounds to explain the course content. The assessments are good and engaging. but on a difficulty level it is extremely difficult course to take. Needs full devotion and time to understand and complete the course.,5
3116,For a long time Machine Learning was an obscure content and I've noticed how I misunderstood the problems and its applications with very little keywords I had heard about this subject. This was a very great introduction for the concepts and I feel very strong especially due to very good teaching manner of Andrew Ng. Very very appreciated and happy to take this course,5
3117,"Amazing! Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher, and even though I had poor programming skills, I could comprehend and solve all the exercises, thus increasing also my programming skills in this process. This was possible mostly because the classes are very clear, as well as the structure and the statements of the exercises. Thank you Andrew Ng, Coursera and support team!",5
3118,"This course is very helpful and was interesting to take, covering a wide range of machine learning concepts and applications. The programming assignments are helpful and lets you better understand each week. Finally, the lecturer is very skillful has a talent in explaining complex ideas. Thank you Andrew Ng! I will definitely take the advanced version of this course.",5
3119,"This course was excellent, Professor Ng is great at explaining concepts and the material is presented clearly and in such a way as to not overwhelm. I especially liked the written lecture summaries that went along with each video during the first few weeks, as well as the week summaries. I intend on going back and completing the optional exercises in the assignments.",5
3120,,5
3121,"This was a great introduction to machine learning. I enjoyed the real world problems that were given in the practice sets. The course does an awesome job of not requiring extensive programming knowledge, and teaches you few tricks along the way. It was also a great opportunity to practice vectorization, which is   a skill always worth bushing up on from time to time.",5
3122,"I would say this is the best coarse on machine learning for the beginners. Sir Andrew Ng, he's the best teacher I have I ever seen. The way he shaped the lectures, quizes and assignments is really matchless. Its free of cost above all. If someone wanna be expert at machine learning but he has no background knowledge, taking this coarse is the best way to get started.  ",5
3123,After completing all coding assesments you know math behind the main machine learning models. You learn which calculations are going on behind each model. That course taught me very useful thing. But it is not for beginners. I mean if you are a beginner you can finish this course of course but can't get grasp of every useful and impertant detail Andrew Ng gives you.,5
3124,"Really great introduction to Machine Learning with generally very approachable exercises and assignments. Some topics like the linear algebra and some of the derivative and partial derivative formulations could have been a bit more in-depth. When a Prof. does a hand wave explanation, it almost guarantees that students will not find the droid they are looking for, ;)",5
3125,"Excellent course! The video lessons were great and very well delivered for easy understanding. The exercises though they could take time to complete are very much needed to truly understand the course and subject material. Overall the course content, the exercises and quizzes were all very well designed and delivered. I feel accomplished to have complete the course.",5
3126,Dr. Andrew has a lot of didactics in explaining fundamental aspects of data science. Several topics and tips are really very important when developing a project in the area.,5
3127,The biggest strength of this course for me was gaining a much better understanding of linear algebra as it is applied to machine learning. I am now quite confident in vectorizing algorithms that would have previously been completed using nested for loops. I think this really separates this course from other online courses in machine learning or AI that I have taken.,5
3128,"Great introduction to Machine Learning algorithms. The course focuses on the concepts. The choice of Matlab/Octave is good since we focus only on the mathematical concepts behind the algorithms. Videos, lectures notes and assignments are great. Explanations given by the teacher are clear. I now have a better understanding of what is Machine Learning and how it work.",5
3129,"Needless to say, this is an excellent course on Machine Learning, which has become a standard introduction to the area. Several other courses are now available on the Web, but Andrew Ng's course has become a standard over the years. The topics it covers, the breadth, the level of mathematics used, the examples and the quick grading all make it a pleasure. Thank you.",5
3130,"I truly enjoyed the course. The knowledge I gained here will last with me throughout my life. I am very happy that I took this course and successfully completed it. I want to say a large thank you to Andrew Ng, for creating this course which is inspiring and will inspire generations to take up AI on the next level. Thank you Sir for making this world a better place.",5
3131,This course is well designed. Prof. Andrew NG has made sure how to escape higher mathematics which may not be learnt by some students.

I am heading into Data Science industry and this course is the best one out there - a must-go-through for anybody who wants to do any Machine Learning.",5
3136,This course is exceptionally well put together. I had this wrong concept that machine learning is a hard nut to crack but Prof. Ng has designed the course in such a way that students get the best out of the machine learning course with fair amount of effort. Nearly to the end of the course. I wish this course was a part of specialization for Machine Learning and AI.,5
3137,Pretty good starter or refresher course. Solid foundational understanding of machine learning and the underlying mathematics. Assignments are relatively easy if you can do vectorized operations and focus on the fundamentals because all the boilerplate code is already provided. Great for non-software developers as well (you do need to understand programming though).,5
3138,The Course is perfect to build the basic solid block of machine learning and neural networks. I started learning with nearly no knowledge of machine learning or neural network. The topics of the course are very clearly explained as possible. Going through course weeks and assignments (especially programming assignments)  my understanding of the topics grew greatly.,5
3139,"This is the first online course I am taking and it is absolutely amazing how efficiently the professor was explaining the material and how well this course was structured. The exercised are well thought and help a lot in the learning process. So BIG THANK YOU to professor ANDREW NG. Highly appreciate it. All the best in your future endeavors. Regards, Dimitar Velev",5

3147,"I learnt much more than machine learning itself from this course. Prof. Ng is a great teacher. The way that he designs and teaches the course is extremely helpful for me to learn new knowledge. For every one who is new to learn machine learning and hopes to learn it, this should be his/her first course. I enjoyed the learning experience so much. Thank you Prof. Ng.",5
3148,"This course has been a very interesting and detailed introduction to machine learning. The fact that it focused so much on the theoretical background behind all the ready-made technologies available now allowed me to gain a much deeper understanding of the different technologies, and the ability to decide for myself what tool to use and which approach to undertake.",5
3149,"A very easy going and clear introduction to machine learning. Comfort with manipulating matrices will help make the course far easier but it can also be completed without this background. Finally, not only did it talk about algorithms and there application it provided great tools for assessing model performance to help decide the best way to improve an application.",5
3150,"Andrew Ng is a terrific teacher who managed to excite both beginners and intermediate learners alike. By making lectures accessible to everyone, being lighter on the technical side and heavier on the practical side, Andrew's course is a perfect introduction for anyone who wants to apply Machine Learning in his / her life and business.

So I just wanted to thank Prof. Ng and his team for creating such a valuable, super cool course. So many thanks!",5
3153,This course  is a really awesome course to get started into Machine Learning.It gives a proper understanding of the machine learning algos and doesn't just make us apply them for the sake of it.Andrew Ng is a very skilled instructor and knows everything about machine learning.One of the best online courses out there.Thanks for developing my interest in this field.,5
3154,I found this course very useful and enjoyable. What really worked for me was the amount of detail into the underlying mathematics and statistics on which the machine learning is based. This gives me a lot of scope to continue my exploration of this fascinating topic. My thanks and gratitude to Andrew Ng and the mentors on the forums for their support and guidance.,5
3155,"This was my first machine learning class and after years of not touching linear algebra, and calculus. This course helped me get back in touch with it yet at same time made the concepts fairly absorbable, especially for the more complex algorithms. What helped the most was how Professor Ng was able to help relate the academics to the application in the real world. ",5
3156,"Andrew Ng did an excellent job with the videos and the course gives many examples for using each topic discussed.  I could have used a little more background information in how some of the programs and libraries in Octave worked, but overall, I learned a lot about Machine Learning and feel like I could get through most of a real-world application.  Thanks, Andrew!",5
3157,It is very well designed course to start learning Machine learning from scratch. The tutorials and graded exercise makes it for explanatory and gives you more intuition about the working of algorithm. The video explanation was very useful and easy to understand. I am surely gonna explore more and take it to next level with deep learning and artificial intelligence,5
3158,"I thought this was an excellent course. I was completely new to Machine Learning at the beginning of the course and have been able to learn not only about all the different algorithms, but also got to see how these were implemented in practice through the quizzes and assignments. I recommend to any beginner with a will to delve in to the world of Machine Learning. ",5

The programming assignments offer great insight on core algorithmic detail while providing skeleton for fast implementation, and are representative of real world machine learning applications. Hope to see more courses from Professor Ng in the future and to get involved with the deep learning curriculum. ",5
3165,"This course is awesome because it is focused on the theoretical part of machine learning. Even though it is the ”hands-on” era, in machine learning it is really important to know the theory. That is because there are enough open-source libraries, so ML engineers do not need to build algorithms from scratch, but they need to know the concepts in order to tune them.",5
3166,,5
3167,This course is great for beginners of Machine Learning. As Prof Andrew  explains each part in details manner. And the practical assignment on the other hand allows you to implement the learnt logic.One of the most Amazing thing is that if you have just shoot a question in discussion forum you get answer very soon as many mentors are active in the discussion forum.,5
3168,The course is really well designed. The assigments are very useful to fully capture the theoretical part.,5

I now graduated this course and what I have to say to someone who has not yet decided: join the course now to make you become an expert in one of the most important technologies today.",5
3193,"Very useful class, and I've learned too many stuff from this class. The exercise was not too hard for me  and I enjoy writing such short and simple piece of codes in Octave rather than other languages like JAVA. But I don't know what to learn next. It would be better if someone could recommend some other classes at the end of the class. Thus I can keep learning.",5
3194,This class gives an excellent introductions to the algorithms and theory behind various ML approaches. I like that it gives the background in the math as opposed to just providing frameworks and calls to pre-written algorithms available in the various libraries. I came away with a much better understanding of the theory to better be able to apply the techniques. ,5
3195,"A great online course. Lots of information that is presented really well with exercises structured to walk you through complex concepts and programming step by step.

Thank you again for this wonderful effort.,5
3199,,5
3200,"Very well structured and interesting course. I came into this course wanting to learn about the fundamentals and not only does this course teach the fundamentals well, but also provides rigorous assignments to allow students to practise the concepts taught in the lecture videos, which in turn sets this course apart from learning through YouTube videos and such.",5
3201,"Excellent course!!! It´s a deep introduction in the issue and covers a lot of topics. It gives you amazing skills to develop your own machine learning systems. It does not require any previous knowlodge, but it will help you much some basic skills in lineal algebra. The exercises in matlab/octave gives you a great experience in building machine learning system.",5
3202,"This course is a very nice option for those who wish to start in Machine Learning, to start almost from scratch, and also for those who have already some knowledge. I think Andrew put a lot of effort in making the explanations very simple and the programming exercises very didactic. Now I know I can build a Machine Learning system myself and thank you for that.",5
3203,"This is an excellent introductory course, if you couple it with other courses in the mathematics of machine learning you can go on to deepen your understanding of the subject in further courses, and also take other courses in specific algorithms such as neural networks, deep learning and understand the workings of machine learning frameworks, not just use them.",5
3204,Professor Andres has taught this class with a very simplistic approach. Enjoyed this class. The programming exercises were very good and helped me understand the concepts better. I would highly recommend this class to someone who is new to machine learning or even someone who has been using the machine learning tools but don't understand the concepts behind it.,5
3205,"Great course with legendary Professor! Beside the whole remarkable fundamental of ML, one of the most interesting part was the last two minutes of the last lecture video.",5
3206,"This was a great course. I got a strong refresher on matrix mathematics, and learned surprising new ways to apply it to complex, real world problems. I learned about different types of machine learning, how and when to apply specific algorithms to problems, and how to debug and tune machine learning algorithms. I'm very happy with the end result of this course.",5
3207,"Top notch course. Excellent balance of hands-on programming exercises which were very motivational of suitable difficulty (assuming you remember matrix and vector algebra well). Good videos and great balance of amount of information vs. not getting too deep for a ""first foray"" into machine learning. Highly recommended, especially with the programming exercises!",5
3208,This is the most amazing course I have come across on Machine Learning. Andrew's explanations are in depth and he explains the mathematics behind machine learning starting from the basics.

3212,"A very good course to start with Machine Learning. Andrew Ngs teaching style is something I wish most professors around the world would follow. The course if filled with examples and it does not flood you with a bunch of scientific words (or at least they are all explained, if used). I can understand now why this course is highly recommended from my colleagues.",5
3213,"The course material is great. In some weeks, the course material gets very lengthy and intense. Once you start getting the programming exercises, they are easier to follow. Professor Andrew Ng's teaching style is easy to follow and so even if you don't know topics such as differential equations or linear algebra, Prof. Ng explains things well enough without it.",5
3214,"A brilliant course and a very nice introduction to machine learning.... Very good material and assignments.... It was really enjoyable too, I was too eager to get it done and I did it in almost 5 weeks....I have few concerns that perhaps help:",5
3215,,5
3216,,5
3217,"Excellent explanations, very clear and illustrative, ideal for those of us with good basis of calculus and linear algebra, but friendly for those without such knowledge.

3220,"This is an excellent course for starters. Dr. Ng is a fantastic instructor. The course content is not difficult for a people with proper engineering background (I'm a mechanical engineer). The design of the course structure and assignments is very good, too. Personally speaking, I have been enjoying learning since the beginning. Thank you, Dr. Ng and Coursera!  ",5
3221,"Very well prepared course materials. The programming assignments were also very well prepared. If there was a way to highlight the errata in each section, it would be even better!",5
3222,"This course was surprisingly good, very practical approach which even many of the technical universities; courses might lack. Great for taking first steps in machine learning and great for revising basic knowledge. It might be also useful for getting some new ideas of how to cope with a specific machine learning problem. Thanks Andrew for creating this course!",5
3223,"A brilliant introduction to Machine Learning, for people of all levels. Really well taught by Andrew Ng, with great example coding challenges on MATLAB.",5
3224,"For me, this course was a game changer, an inflection point. A hot and complex topic was delivered in an elegant, involving and pleasant manner, building up passion in this receiving end -at least. Only by truly mastering the subject, and counting on a very hard work of preparing academic resources, you can convey this result. Thank you, Andrew and colleagues!",5
3225,It's a great introduction into machine learning for people who want to understand how algorithms work under the hood. Some popular algorithms are not covered though. Those are decision trees and random forests. Still I really enjoyed the course and would highly recommend it to others. I plan on taking Andrew Ng's courses from deep learning specialization next! ,5
3226,"The best course to learn machine learning I’ve done so far. Rather than just calling methods that do magic machine learning for you, here you learn how machine learning actually works, how to mathematically implement machine learning algorithms, how to evaluate them and other math-gic that makes machine learning possible (to some extent). Thank you too Andrew,",5
3227,Sir Andrew Ag  is the most awesome teacher to learn machine learning.His course gave me explicable knowledge about ML. Topics were sufficiently explained and the thing I liked most is he had his own way to make you understand tough concepts. ,5
3228,"I love this course. It is intended for all levels and being online, you can do it at your own pace. If you have advanced knowledge in optimization algorithms, programming and strong Linear Algebra fundations, I recommend this course to broaden your knowledge about potential applications and know many new tricks when applying these to machine learning problems.",5
3229,My suggestion is that  this course should be furhter divided into two areas of supervised learning and unsupervised learning and those who want to reaseach in particular area should study those videos and I am really really grateful to Andrew Ng for such great and simple lectures explaining complicated things in a very simple way.Once Again thank you very much,5
3230,"Awesome course, great material high enough level to avoid getting stuck in the muddy mathematical details, but very practical with great programming exercises. I took machine learning courses at a top Tech university but this class really helped cement ideas and provide great intuition on the various concepts taught. Excellent course and I highly recommend it.",5
3231,"A fast, quick, dirty introduction to Machine Learning. Professor Ng's instructions are top-notch. Having said that, a lot of detailed math (i.e. calculus, linear algebra, stats) are glossed over, so if you want to truly understand certain topics, you should consider reading a book, or taking Ng's CS 229 Machine Learning lectures at Stanford (videos on Youtube)",5
3232,Excellent course with very easy-to-understand instructions from Professor Andrew. I've already learned some machine learning techniques but I gained a deeper understanding after this course. The coding assignments are generally not difficult but it would be great if you could also spend time learning the pre-coded files to gain more insights of the algorithms.,5
3233,"Well structured course and the pacing is just right. Loved the way Prof. Andrew explains the key concepts and the information given is more than adequate for every single person to follow this course. Finally a word on the mentors, they were helpful in addressing any issues faced by the students and overall were a great help to successfully finish this course.",5
3234,"This was my first foray into ML. Really enjoyed the course - the videos, programming assignments, following the discussions. Prof. Ng is a wonderful proponent of the subject. This course has given me a platform, which I can hopefully build on. My sincere thanks to Prof. Ng and the mentors (who painstakingly go through the forums to answer questions and guide).",5
3235,"Amazing course. The videos were extremely instructive, and detailed. Andrew went through every single aspect no matter how trivial or easy it may seem very slowly and carefully and it really helped in being able to complete the assignments and pass the quizzes. The assignments also were not too difficult and helped reinforce the material learned in the course. ",5
3236,"Wonderful course with understandable examples and straight forward
 theories. Assignments have great structure and supports which can save students plenty of time in finding out the proper direction in solving the problem and narrow down the question into some key points which can maximize the enhancement and practice of the understanding from previous classes

",5
3237,"Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher! He makes the material approachable and excites you about learning new ideas and strategies. Fully recommend this course for anyone interested in machine learning. My math was 18 years rusty, only having done mostly basic algebra in writing computer software, but was able to follow the math outlined in his course, no problems.",5
3238,"Awesome course.Professor Andrew Ng explains in a great way several machine learning methods - without getting lost in the maths behind! - , their algorithms and how to do the debugging of the problems that may arise in real life applications. The computing assignments reinforced the machine learning concepts understanding also superbly. Totally recommeended!!! ",5
3239,This machine learning course was really helpful to me.,5
3240,"Amazing Instructor. Every MOOC instructor should watch a few videos of Andrew teaching ML.Sharing Personal experiences, providing industry insights and making the course fun and real life oriented. Using a pen along with slides is very important. Just reading out and explaining slides makes lectures boring and many students drop out of courses for this reason.",5
3241,Great course.  I found the exercises were challenging at first but after a while you start figuring things out.  The lectures managed to provide excellent intuitions as to what each ML method attempts to do and how to evaluate the obtained results.  The course was extremely interesting and I certainly wish to go on learning more on the subject.  Thanks a lot!,5
3242,Amazing course. Prof Andrew Ng is one of the best professor i know under it have i taken an online course. I have taken many online course but this was the most interesting and time worthy.

3245,Machine learning had always been an intriguing but intricate are for me. I was in search of a repository where I could not only get hold of the concepts but also get a hands-on. This course has helped me achieve this goal in a simple yet comprehensive manner. The teaching style of Andrew Ng Sir is a very refined one and helped me grasp the concepts with ease.,5
3246,"It has been great experiencing learning Machine learning technique with different algorithm in such a great and deep way. I really enjoy the course, only face difficulty in order to follow up the lab assignment as it was little complex. While going through very 1st time it was hard to understand and grab the entire programming code provided in the assignment.",5
3247,very nice and systematic overview of ML. Solid and important math foundation necessary for understanding how it is applied to the real life problems is also introduced but not too much of a focus on the math deduction itself. So very practical. The programming problems are very well designed and mostly related to the real problems as well. Highly recommended. ,5
3248,"this course serves as a quick view into the machine learning field. It saves a lot of the mathematical details, which makes it easy to follow and unable to grasp the mechanism behinds the actions. One last thing I don' t like about this course is the homework, which needs to be finished by matlab rather than Python. Above all, Andrew is really a good teacher. ",5
3249,Excellent online course from an ex-engineer who is attempting to re-engage in engineering fields.,5
3250,The Course is great for absolute beginners. The instructor speaks clearly and explains well. The Lectures are delivered at a speed which is great for students who are not comfortable with English although native English speakers can speed up the videos to 1.5x and still understand the concepts. The forums have done a great job in explaining the matlab doubts.,5
3251,"Whether you are completely new on ML or someone that learned about these topics some time ago and want to get back on track, you should find this course very useful.",5
3252,"Actually, I have watched some videos of Machine Learning from Ng several years ago. This time, for an occasional reason, I could spare my time to learn this course systemly. I think even if I've been familiar with some part of knowledge points, it is still helpful for me to get a whole view of machine learning. So, thanks for this course, thank you Andrew Ng.",5
3253,"Really amazing course in my opinion, it works really well for a beginner like myself to understand what is machine learning and how can we implement it. I will continue working on my own set of problem with these new set of knowledge I just learn. Thank you Prof. Ng and everybody on discussion board, it has been a lot of help and ton fun working these course. ",5
3254,Many important machine learning concepts and algorithms explained. All the concepts were taught with practical importance.

3256,"This was a great course, with a very talented and engaged teacher in Professor Ng. I felt I got a great understanding of Machine Learning from this course, and it has provided me with a great basis for my upcoming bachelor thesis. I had very few complaints, mainly about the programming assignments being a bit vague at times. Overall a great experience though.",5
3257,"Fantastic course, and great selections of topics.  The video lectures are outstanding, and the quizzes are well-designed.  The programming assignments are good too, though they don't leave much room for creativity -- many are a bit too much ""fill in the blanks"".  But I realize that it would be hard to allow more free-form assignments in an auto-graded course.",5
3258,"Great experience, great course. I love the way Andrew explains the context of ML. If you are starting off in the ML field it's the right course for you as Andrew shares insights from his experience that would otherwise take you years to get. I totally recommend this course to anyone and particularily to those that want to start or advance their careers in ML.",5
3259,"Hi, Andrew Ng. Thank you a lot to create this wonderful online course. I had learn much not only the knowledge about machine learning but also about the way of critical thinking to solve problem. I also work in education field and I knew that it take lot of time of thinking, preparing, editing to create such a long and detail course. I am very appreciated it.",5
3260,"I enjoyed going through this course with the purpose of refreshing my previous studies on the subject. I feel more comfortable about the various topics now, Even if at times I missed more in depth maths, I think that this editorial choice helped in the end to give a comprehensive and organic outlook on the basics of machine learning. Thanks you so much Andrew",5

3263,"Excellent course to take when studying machine learning, good introduction as to how specific algorithms are being utilize and how they work. Would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn Machine Learning in theory and practical application. Don't expect this to be programming course for Machine Learning is more of how things work and how to apply them.",5
3264,Help me greatly to understand various machine learning algorithms.  The tests and the programming assignments also strengthen my understanding of the class materials.  The programming assignments are tough enough to push myself to work harder and review the class materials harder in order to complete them.  But finishing all these assignments are achievable.  ,5
3265,I wish Andrew was my high school teacher.The way he explained the concepts and problem space for ML with real life examples is truly rewarding for the students who take this course. The quiz and the assignments are quite helpful and reading the code provided it self gives an insight into lot of other details to be considered. A must course for any beginners.,5
3266,Incredible! ,5
3267,"Excellent course for all levels of Machine-Learning-enthusiasts. The programing exercises are challenging enough, especially if you want to finish it in the normal 3-hour time frame. However, this can be done, if you understand the materials correctly and if you have a background in programming. Strongly recommended if you want to start to learn about ML/IA.",5
3268,"This is an excellent course and I highly recommend it to students who are interested in machine learning.  It gives a very comprehensive overview on supervised and unsupervised learning.  Moreover, the importance with analysis on the Machine Learning algorithms will help to prioritise resources and save time improving the accuracy of the designed algorithms.",5
3269,"A great introduction to the Machine Learning world for non-specialists. Andrew Ng manages to cover a wide variety of concepts giving the necessary intuitions of the maths behind but without going too much into technical details. I would have perhaps preferred the coding exercises in a more widely spread language like Python, but actually Octave does the job. ",5
3270,"I, as a linguist, learned really a lot during this course and I vividly recommend it to everyone interested in ML applications. I knew nothing about this topic before, now I am more confident and I feel challenged to think of how to apply ML techniques to language and text. I must say, however, that the programming assignments were difficult, so be prepared.",5
3271,"This is one of the best begineer course for machine learning. Became a big big fan of Andrew Ng Sir, the way he focuses on small background theories, intuitions to algorithm really make those lectures more understandable. If you want to know, what's the underlying math in machine learning algorithm, how does it perform everything so easily, grab this course.",5
3272,"Probably the best course to learn about machine learning. The pace is just right and the teacher top notch. If one thing, I'd like the assignments to go in slightly greater details, but then that would limit how many people can take and complete the class I guess...",5
3273,"I like a lot this course. i want to give a message to who is looking for a course of machine learning: it is a amazing course, never give up, be patient and use the tutorials, and take notes, and review them, Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and my virtual tutor Tom Mosher, you are the Best. Thanks a lot. If i finished this course all of you can do it. Best Regards",5
3274,"Outstanding course, very well presented even though the material is a few years old. A good mix of videos explaining motivation and algorithms versus challenging programming exercises. Gives a solid foundation in machine learning that will let you move on to more specialized courses, like Andrew Ng's new series on deep learning. Can't wait to start that one!",5
3275,I found this course pretty reasonable. All i wanted in machine learning is available in this course. I didn't want to know just about any python machine learning package or something similar.
