Sophia,Applied MSc in Data Science & AI,"No, it wasn't clear","Personally I found the way the class was taught quite abstract and cryptic. I was expecting a point of view more conceptually visual (with this I mean based on real examples rather than a series of slides displaying the theoretical part black over white with coins and dices examples from time to time). From this point of view, I was left with a feeling of missed chance of having an introduction to statistics and probability focused on Data Science / Engeneering /Analytics from someone with experience in the sector. Instead, I was left with the feeling of have had a standard cryptic class that you would find in any undergraduate program without further ambitions of really soak deeply into the students.","Yes, partially","His English was good and his explanations about the topics were okay. However, I felt like many times he avoided getting into examples or sometimes he just read equations instead of trying to explain the concepts behind.","No, it wasn't clear","Personally I feel like statistics and probability are subjects that hold strong intuitions behind that are only perceived by facing examples and exercises, however the content was mainly explained from a rather aseptic theoretical point of view.","Yes, partially",The questions raised in class were answered with no further problem.,Hard,"As I said, I think the way the class was conceived and taught made the concepts harder than they actually are. ","The fact that the reference book was left on Moodle and the script about the eggs problem also uploaded to moodle, I had fun toying around with it on my own. ","The way of presenting the subject and teaching the class, as described in the previous comments.","I feel like a have a good take away of the statistic and probability concepts explained, but mainly after taking the time of translating them from the way they were presented into the concepts they hold on my own.","Yes, partially","Yes, he insisted on how many concepts fit on the upcoming statistical inference classes among others.","Yes. Principally the probability distributions. It was a bit confusing to start talking about geometric distributions for example without having presented them (Poisson, binomial, Bernouilli appeared in some examples but were not properly introduced). Also I feel like as we talked about random sampling and the CLT, it was the moment to introduce sampling techniques as Bootstraping for example.","I think it was really discouraging the teacher's approach towards many topics, as ""I am sorry they are this arid but this is the way it is"". Honestly I think the main value added by a teacher is making the class content more approachable and understandable, hearing him present this excuse before facing many topics leaves you with the feeling that he did not really try, specially after having to check other resources to understand the topics after class and finding them much better explained in other sites."

Off-campus,Applied MSc in Data Science & AI,"Yes, partially","The professor was very knowledgeable, he explained all the concepts and gave lots of examples which I found helpful.

Paris,Applied MSc in Data Science & AI,"Yes, partially",Hard to follow on R as it wasn't taught before and the course used advanced scripting and functions,"Yes, partially",It could've been more engaging by using slides or blackboards completely. Constant change made it hard to focus,"Yes, partially",,"Yes, absolutely",,Hard,,The content and planning of the class were really great and the professor explained from the practical point of view,"- Pedagogy: The concepts covered today were familiar to some of us, however the instruction haphazardly jumped from topics ⇾ examples ⇾ R, which made the simpler topics seem complex. Like Pr Auroux, it would be better to explain first, take examples on board - have a Q&A and then move to explain it in R

- Examples: It would be extremely helpful to take fewer examples and explain step by step on blackboard and then transit to R at a slower pace as many of us don't have an R background

- Blackboard: An stylus based tablet/laptop will easier for the professor to write and us to understand what is written, so the blackboard notes would be helpful for a long-time

- Time split between theory & R: As I understand it's the foundation course on Statistics and its final assessment will be taken as MCQ like previous course, it would be better to give theory and solving problems on blackboard/slides more proportion of the class than practising more examples on R","Foundational understanding of probability, distribution and density functions","Yes, absolutely",,"Fewer examples.

An option should be that the teacher explains us very quickly what he did (with a lot of comments in his code), and tells us to have a look at it afterwards, and this should not last more than 15 min. Another option that I would have preferred is that he gives us a program to complete ourselves, with indications on how to fill the missing parts (ex: first create a vector for ..., then use this function, and let us search for the good parameters, etc...), and we make the correction together afterwards. 
General comment is that we don't have time to watch all the recordings after the courses, therefore during the course time we should be able to learn a maximum, and the teacher should not go too fast (he was often saying: you have the recordings...). The right pace is when he writes on the blackboard (ex during exercices), otherwise he is going too fast on slides.",How to solve (simple) problems with probabilities,"Yes, absolutely",,Some R practical session,

1. The pace of the class was quite fast and we noted this to him often
2. I believe he might not be used to the remote teaching materials very much. The use of the black board was hard for us to follow.
3. The class content seemed to be muddled up especially in the middle. It was hard to understand how each concept flowed into what.","Yes, absolutely","Yes questions was answered , the concern might be that the right ones were not asked.

2. How the mathematical concepts come to life in a sample data 
3.
